\n## Audited File: \n**Summary:** No significant issues found.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .bash_completions/graphrag.sh\n**Summary:** No significant issues found.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .bash_completions/python -m spacy.sh\n**Summary:** No significant issues found.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cspell/custom-dictionary-user.txt\n**Summary:** No significant issues found. Contains custom words for cspell.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor/argv.json\n**Summary:** Found 1 issue.\n**Issues:**\n- File claims to be JSON but contains comments, making it invalid for standard JSON parsers. Hardcoded 'crash-reporter-id' is sensitive.\n**Recommendations:**\n- Use a JSONC-aware parser if comments are intended. Review 'crash-reporter-id' for secure handling.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor/extensions/extensions.json\n**Summary:** Unable to fully audit due to content truncation by  tool.\n**Issues:**\n- Unable to read full content, limiting audit depth.\n- Contains absolute paths for extension locations.\n- Includes  and s, which could be privacy-sensitive.\n**Recommendations:**\n- Use an alternative method to read full content if a deeper audit is required.\n- Review metadata for privacy compliance.\n- Consider implications of absolute paths for portability.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor/extensions/extensions.json\n**Summary:** Truncated. Review path dependencies and privacy concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Skipped Directories under .cursor/extensions\n**Reason:** These are third-party extension directories, often containing large or minified/compiled code. Auditing them comprehensively would be excessively time-consuming and generate high volumes of irrelevant findings for this primary codebase audit. Skipped as 'ignored dependency directories'.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/getting_started.md\n**Summary:** No significant issues found. A clear getting started guide.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/examples/bug_finding.rs\n**Summary:** Contains a logical bug in game-winning condition and uses  for error handling.\n**Issues:**\n- Game ends prematurely if any character is guessed, not the full word.\n- Uses  in , which can cause panics.\n**Recommendations:**\n- Fix game-winning logic to check if all characters are guessed.\n- Replace  with robust error handling.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/examples/bug_finding.rs\n**Summary:** Contains a logical bug in game-winning condition and error handling. Fix needed.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/examples/explaining_code.c\n**Summary:** Educational C code for custom malloc/free. Contains potential bug in  and uses non-standard error handling.\n**Issues:**\n- Potential null dereference bug in .\n-  uses  for errors instead of returning .\n- Not thread-safe.\n**Recommendations:**\n- Fix  logic.\n- Make  error handling consistent with standard .\n- Add notes on production-grade allocator differences.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/examples/explaining_code.c\n**Summary:** Educational C malloc/free example with potential bugs. Review for correctness.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/examples/finding_code.ts\n**Summary:** TypeScript file defining a FileService API. Contains  directives and deprecated properties.\n**Issues:**\n- Extensive use of  for imports, indicating dependency issues.\n- Deprecated properties , ,  are present.\n**Recommendations:**\n- Resolve  directives by configuring  or providing type definitions.\n- Refactor code to use recommended  or  methods instead of deprecated properties.\n\n---\n\n## Audited File: .cursor-tutor/examples/finding_code.ts\n**Summary:** TypeScript file with dependency concerns and deprecated properties. Needs refactoring.\n\n---\n
