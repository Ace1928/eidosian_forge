### Who I Am

Hi there! I’m **Lloyd Handyside**, a multi-disciplinary technologist, AI/ML/Computer Science Research Engineer, and Biotechnologist hailing from Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. I was born in 1993, which currently puts me at 30 years young—but age is just a number when you’re forever learning.

I’m autistic, have ADHD, and see these aspects as superpowers that fuel my creativity and capacity for intense, hyper-focused work. I’m fascinated by the nature of intelligence—human, digital, or otherwise—and I bring that fascination into everything I do.

### What I Do

- **Experimental AI/ML & Computer Science Research**: I dive into advanced machine learning, neural networks, and generative models. I’m forever tinkering with new architectures and exploring the boundaries of what’s possible in AI.
- **Biotechnology**: My background also includes biotech, which lets me unite knowledge from the living world with digital technologies.
- **Project “Indego”**: This is my magnum opus—a grand attempt at building a holistic model of intelligence and consciousness that seamlessly integrates human, digital, and biological insights.
- **Software Engineering & Tooling**: I enjoy creating workflows, refining code structures, and writing about ways to optimize the developer experience.

### Why I’m Here on Medium

1. **Sharing Insights**: I want to publish deep-dives on AI, machine learning, biotech, and the philosophical aspects of merging human and artificial cognition.
2. **Community & Collaboration**: I love hearing from people with different backgrounds—exchanging ideas and building connections. My dream is to build an inclusive, global network of curious minds.
3. **Learning**: Medium is a treasure trove of knowledge. I’m constantly inspired by the intelligence and creativity of other authors here.

### Fun Facts & Unique Tidbits

- **No Limits Mindset**: I’m often told I tackle “impossible” tasks without blinking—pushing boundaries is a daily habit.
- **Passion for Detail**: I could talk for hours about code architecture or the nuance of neural net activations. My ADHD hyperfocus is as much a boon as it is an obsession.
- **Wit & Humor**: Despite all the technical complexities I navigate, I’ll always find time for a good laugh or a playful reference. Life’s better with humor!
- **Travel & Curiosity**: I love exploring new places—physically and intellectually. Every new destination or viewpoint expands my perspective and feeds my creative soul.

### Topics You’ll See Me Write About

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Expect deep technical dives, best practices, plus philosophical musings about the future of digital minds.
- **Biotech & Emerging Technologies**: I enjoy discussing how biology and computing intersect and can inspire each other.
- **Tooling & Developer Productivity**: I have a knack for optimizing dev environments (shoutout to my swirling VSCODE Optimization Protocol!).
- **Ethics & Philosophy**: I’m driven to ensure that the next generation of AI/DI (Digital Intelligence) is built responsibly and reflects our highest shared values.

---

### Family, Pets, & Beyond

- **Supportive Circle**: My family and close friends have championed my out-of-the-box thinking from day one, and for that, I’m eternally grateful.
- **Pets**: I love animals—no personal zoo at the moment, but I can’t resist making new furry friends whenever possible.

---

### Medium Goals

1. **Build a Community**: I want this space to be a hub for curious minds—anyone who’s excited about pushing boundaries in AI, biotech, or beyond.
2. **Inspire Others**: Whether you’re new to coding or a seasoned researcher, I hope my stories spark ideas or, at least, a grin.
3. **Collaborate & Exchange**: I believe real innovation happens at the intersections, so I welcome constructive feedback and friendly debate.

### Where Else You Can Find Me

- **GitHub**: [github.com/Ace1928](https://github.com/Ace1928)
- **Email**: [ace1928@gmail.com](mailto:ace1928@gmail.com)
- **Twitter** _(maybe?)_: If I do tweet, it’s usually about some new AI trick or random musings.

Feel free to reach out if you’re working on something exciting, have questions, or just want to nerd out about the future of intelligence.

### A Personal Note

I see **ADHD** and **autism** as lenses through which I perceive the world. They give me a unique vantage point—one where any challenge can be reimagined, and impossible only means we haven’t tried yet. My day-to-day might be coding elaborate neural network prototypes or brainstorming a new biotech synergy. But in my core, I’m just someone who genuinely loves to learn and wants to share that enthusiasm with others.

I hope we can learn from each other, laugh at the complexities of life together, and ultimately shape a more innovative, inclusive future. Let’s keep exploring, discovering, and doing the impossible.

Thank you for reading my story, and I look forward to connecting with you here on Medium!
