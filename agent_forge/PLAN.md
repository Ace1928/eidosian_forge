# Plan: agent_forge

Date: 2026-02-19
Primary Track: Consciousness kernel hardening and RAC-AP validation.

## Active Plan Documents
- `agent_forge/docs/CONSCIOUSNESS_RAC_AP_RESEARCH_2026-02-19.md`
- `agent_forge/docs/CONSCIOUSNESS_RAC_AP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Program Goals
1. Maintain high-integrity GNW-style runtime behavior under perturbation.
2. Replace rhetorical claims with falsifiable construct-validation outputs.
3. Tie internal metrics to external task robustness and security boundaries.

## Workstream Status
- [x] ~~Consciousness kernel, modules, perturbations, and benchmark stack implemented.~~
- [x] ~~Winner-linked ignition tracing and ablation matrix implemented.~~
- [x] ~~Autotune and experiment-designer modules implemented.~~
- [ ] RAC-AP protocol schema and validation engine finalized.
- [ ] Validation CLI/MCP integration finalized.
- [ ] Security-boundary stress suite fully integrated into validation gates.

## Immediate Execution Order
1. Implement RAC-AP protocol contract and report generator.
2. Wire validation into `eidctl consciousness` commands.
3. Add tests for construct validity math, gates, and CLI integration.
4. Run manual validation pass and persist artifacts.

## Done Criteria
A cycle is done only when:
- tests pass,
- reports are persisted and reproducible,
- docs are updated,
- and evidence is explicitly tied to falsification gates.
