## 🔭 Long-term Vision

### The Autonomous Agent System

> A self-improving agent orchestration framework capable of planning, executing, and learning from complex multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention.

#### Vision Features

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Agent-to-agent communication
   - Task delegation
   - Consensus protocols

2. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Learn from successes/failures
   - Strategy optimization
   - Self-tuning parameters

3. **Robust Execution**
   - Graceful failure recovery
   - Checkpoint/resume
   - Distributed execution

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Test coverage | 70% | 95% |
| Task success rate | N/A | 90% |
| Concurrent agents | 1 | 10+ |
