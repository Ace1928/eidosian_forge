# Roadmap: agent_forge

## Current Line: E3.9 (Consciousness Validation)

### Delivered
- Consciousness runtime kernel with persistent module state.
- Multi-module GNW-style broadcast and winner competition.
- Winner-linked ignition trace metrics and explicit ignition events.
- Perturbation harness, trials, benchmark suite, ablation matrix, red-team campaign.
- Integrated benchmark runner (kernel + MCP + local LLM + adversarial pass).

### In Progress
- RAC-AP construct validation engine (reliability + convergent/discriminant + falsification gates).
- Protocolized, versioned research artifacts for repeatable claim evaluation.

## Next Milestones

### E4.0: RAC-AP Protocol + Validation
- Protocol schema and expected relationship contracts.
- Validation reports from benchmark/trial/red-team history.
- CLI and MCP surfaces for latest validation status.

### E4.1: Security-Integrated Agency Validation
- Prompt/tool boundary takeover stressors.
- Boundary integrity score as hard pass gate.
- Recovery-latency and attack-success tracking in validation output.

### E4.2: External Robustness Coupling
- External task benchmark adapters and deterministic import paths.
- Perturbation-conditioned task robustness curves.
- Cross-run drift detection with threshold governance.

### E4.3: Publishable Evidence Pipeline
- Pre-registered protocol artifacts.
- Reproducibility bundle (seed, SHA, event digest, gate outcomes).
- Continuous validation and drift review automation.
