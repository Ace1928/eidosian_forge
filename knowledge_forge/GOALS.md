# Goals: knowledge_forge

**Version**: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
**Focus**: Semantic knowledge graph for AI cognition

---

## 🎯 Immediate Goals (This Sprint)

- [ ] Add ROADMAP, ISSUES, PLAN documentation
- [ ] Complete README.md documentation
- [ ] Verify 100% type safety (mypy)
- [ ] Ensure 85%+ test coverage
- [ ] Clean up template bloat

## 🏃 Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

- [ ] RDF/OWL format support for interoperability
- [ ] GraphRAG deep integration
- [ ] Automatic relationship inference
- [ ] Graph visualization dashboard

## 🔭 Long-term Vision

### The Semantic Knowledge Layer

> A scalable knowledge graph that enables AI agents to build, query, and reason over semantic networks, supporting complex inference and cross-domain knowledge integration.

#### Vision Features

1. **Semantic Web Compatibility**
   - RDF/OWL import/export
   - SPARQL query support
   - Linked data integration

2. **Intelligent Reasoning**
   - Automatic relationship inference
   - Contradiction detection
   - Knowledge gap identification

3. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Distributed graph storage
   - Incremental indexing
   - Federation protocol

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Test coverage | 75% | 95% |
| Node capacity | 10k | 1M+ |
| Query latency | 50ms | <10ms |
