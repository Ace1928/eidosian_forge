# Goals: word_forge

**Version**: 0.6.0 → 1.0.0
**Focus**: The living lexicon - semantic understanding at scale

---

## 🎯 Immediate Goals (This Sprint)

- [ ] Refactor `config.py` (44k LOC) into modular components
- [ ] Add CURRENT_STATE, GOALS, ROADMAP, ISSUES, PLAN docs
- [ ] Ensure integration with eidos_mcp for MCP tool exposure
- [ ] Verify all tests pass with authentic backends
- [ ] Document centralised config integration

## 🏃 Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Batch embedding generation
  - [ ] Async graph operations
  - [ ] Lazy loading of heavy dependencies
  
- [ ] **Enhanced Graph Analysis**
  - [ ] Community detection algorithms
  - [ ] Path analysis (shortest semantic path)
  - [ ] Temporal graph evolution
  
- [ ] **Improved Emotion System**
  - [ ] Multi-language support
  - [ ] Context-aware emotion detection
  - [ ] Emotion trajectory tracking

- [ ] **MCP Integration**
  - [ ] Expose word lookup as MCP tool
  - [ ] Graph query via MCP
  - [ ] Emotion analysis tool

## 🔭 Long-term Vision

### The Living Lexicon

> A self-evolving semantic knowledge base that understands language at multiple levels - from individual words to complex concepts, emotions, and relationships - serving as the linguistic foundation for AI agents.

#### Vision Features

1. **Multi-Modal Understanding**
   - Text, speech, and visual concept linking
   - Cross-modal semantic search
   - Unified concept representation

2. **Temporal Evolution**
   - Track word meaning changes over time
   - Neologism detection and integration
   - Historical semantic analysis

3. **Contextual Awareness**
   - Domain-specific vocabularies
   - Register/formality detection
   - Cultural and regional variations

4. **Active Learning**
   - Learn from usage patterns
   - Automatic relationship discovery
   - Self-correction mechanisms

## 🚀 Aspirational Capabilities

### Semantic Reasoning Engine
- Analogy completion (A is to B as C is to ?)
- Conceptual composition (combining meanings)
- Logical inference over semantic relationships

### Natural Language Understanding
- Deep parsing beyond surface syntax
- Pragmatic interpretation
- Discourse coherence modeling

### Creative Language Generation
- Poetry and prose generation
- Style transfer
- Word invention with meaning
