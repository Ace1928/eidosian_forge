# TODO: code_forge

## 🚨 High Priority
- Refactor: Isolate `forgeengine` (Done -> narrative_forge).
- Implement: Created `code_forge/` package structure.
- CLI: Implemented `code_forge.cli` using `typer`.

## 🟡 Medium Priority
- Feature: Implemented basic AST traversal using `ast`.
- Feature: Implemented `CodeLibrarian` (JSON backend).

## 🟢 Low Priority
- Integration: Connect with `eidos_brain` for "Agentic Coding".
- Vector: Upgrade Librarian to use ChromaDB.
```

**Current Status:**
The `code_forge/TODO.md` file lists the current status of the project and includes a high-level overview. The content is structured with sections for different priority levels, including detailed descriptions of each item's status.

**Potential Future Directions:**
- Refactor further to improve efficiency.
- Integrate with `eidos_brain` for more sophisticated agentic coding capabilities.
- Explore upgrading Librarian's backend from JSON to a database like ChromaDB for enhanced search and retrieval performance.
