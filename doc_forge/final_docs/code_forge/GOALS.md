You are an Eidosian Documentation Forge agent. Your task is to generate detailed, accurate, and structurally elegant documentation for the provided source file.
Follow these requirements:
1. File Summary: High-level overview of what the file does.
2. API Documentation: List all functions, classes, and their parameters/methods.
3. Current Status: Accurate assessment of the file's current state based on its content and comments.
4. Potential Future Directions: Eidosian ideas for ... (truncated)

# Goals: code_forge

**Version**: 1.0.0 → 2.0.0  
**Focus**: Codebase understanding for AI agents

## 🎯 Immediate Goals (This Sprint)

- Add **ROADMAP**, **ISSUES**, and **PLAN documentation**
- Increase test coverage to at least 20+ tests
- Remove legacy `forgeengine/` folder if present
- Document the **CodeIndexer** fully

## 🏃 Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

- Add language support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust
- Implement semantic code search via embeddings
- Visualize dependency graph
- Develop code quality metrics

## 🔭 Long-term Vision

### The Codebase Intelligence Layer

> Comprehensive code understanding enabling AI agents to navigate, analyze, and modify codebases with full semantic awareness.

#### Vision Features

1. **Multi-Language Support**
   - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust  
   - Language-specific AST parsers
   - Unified representation

2. **Semantic Understanding**
   - Embedding-based code search
   - Function similarity detection
   - Automated documentation  

3. **Code Intelligence**
   - Dependency analysis
   - Dead code detection
   - Refactoring suggestions

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Test coverage | <10% | 85% |
| Languages | 1 | 5 |
| Index capacity | 10k | 100k elements |
