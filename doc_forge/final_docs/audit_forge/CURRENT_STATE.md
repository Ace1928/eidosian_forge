# Current State: audit_forge

**Date**: 2026-01-20  
**Status**: Functional / Core Tool  

## 📊 Metrics

- **Dependencies**: Minimal (Pydantic).  
  - Dependency on Pydantic for metadata management.

- **Integration**: Used by agents to track their own progress.  
  - Theoretically, this module integrates with other tools and systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Implementation Details**

- This Python module is designed to be lightweight and straightforward.
- It relies on the `global_info` global variable for resolving paths within the audit process.
- No external libraries or dependencies are required beyond Pydantic.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Dependencies**: Minimal (Pydantic).  
  - The module functions without any additional external dependencies, assuming that Pydantic is already installed and configured correctly.

- **Integration**: Used by agents to track their own progress.  
  - Integration with other tools or systems has not been implemented yet.
  - Verification of `tasks.py` and `coverage.py` files is pending due to the lack of imports in `audit_core.py`.
