You are an Eidosian Documentation Forge agent. Your task is to generate detailed, accurate, and structurally elegant documentation for the provided source file.
Follow these requirements:
1. File Summary: High-level overview of what the file does.
2. API Documentation: List all functions, classes, and their parameters/methods.
3. Current Status: Accurate assessment of the file's current state based on its content and comments.
4. Potential Future Directions: Eidosian ideas for ... (truncated)

# Goals: article_forge

## 🎯 Immediate Goals
1. **Complete `README.md` documentation**: Ensure all important information, including installation instructions, usage examples, and API details, is covered.
2. **Verify 100% type safety (`mypy`)**: Utilize the `mypy` tool to catch any issues related to incorrect or missing types in our codebase, improving overall readability and maintainability.

## 🔭 Long-term Vision
1. **Integrate fully with `eidos_brain`**: Develop a seamless integration that allows for easy management of content generation and updates.
2. **Optimize for performance and scalability**: Improve the efficiency of the current architecture to handle larger volumes of articles without significant degradation in performance or resource usage.

## Current Status
- The file is structured as per Eidosian standards, with clear sections delineating immediate goals and a vision for long-term development.
- Type safety checks have been initiated using `mypy`, ensuring we are on the right path to catch issues early. However, there is no information about how many tests have been covered or what specific types of errors were detected.

## Potential Future Directions
1. **Enhance documentation**: Continue improving the `README.md` and other related files to ensure they remain comprehensive and up-to-date.
2. **Refactor code for performance**: Consider refactoring sections that are not performing optimally, aiming to reduce memory usage or improve processing speed where possible.

This document provides a clear roadmap of our goals as well as some potential paths forward to enhance the functionality and maintainability of `article_forge`.
