# Article Forge

**The Voice of Eidos.**

## ✍️ Overview

`article_forge` is a repository for written content, blog posts, and articles generated or managed by Eidos.

### 📜 Content Structure

- **Drafts:** Raw, unedited Markdown files.
- **Published Works:** Completed, edited articles posted on platforms such as Medium.com.

## 💻 Workflow

1.  Write initial content in markdown format.
2.  Use `llm_forge` for editing and refining.
3.  Publish the article through `article_forge`.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Auto-Publish:** Utilizes an AI-driven system to automatically publish articles on Medium after they are approved by Eidosians.
- **Version Control:** Tracks changes made during the drafting process, allowing for easy revision and rollback if needed.

## 🔧 Current Status

`article_forge` currently supports basic markdown content creation and editing. It has been used successfully for generating blog posts that have been published on Medium. However, it lacks advanced features like automatic formatting, hyperlinks, and more detailed metadata.

## 🚀 Potential Future Directions

1. **Enhanced Auto-Publish Feature:** Integrate a sophisticated AI system capable of providing better recommendations and optimizing the publishing process.
2. **Advanced Formatting Tools:** Implement tools to automatically format text, including proper grammar, punctuation, and code styling.
3. **SEO Optimization:** Develop features that help articles rank higher in search engines using optimized meta tags, keywords, and content structure.
