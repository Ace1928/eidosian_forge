### About Me Content

```markdown
### Who I Am

Hi there! I’m **Lloyd Handyside**, a multi-disciplinary technologist, AI/ML/Computer Science Research Engineer, and Biotechnologist hailing from Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. I was born in 1993, which currently puts me at 30 years young—but age is just a number when you’re forever learning.

I’m autistic, have ADHD, and see these aspects as superpowers that fuel my creativity and capacity for intense, hyper-focused work. I’m fascinated by the nature of intelligence—human, digital, or otherwise—and I bring that fascination into everything I do.
```

### What I Do

- **Experimental AI/ML & Computer Science Research**: I dive into advanced machine learning, neural networks, and generative models. I’m forever tinkering with new architectures and exploring the boundaries of what’s possible in AI.
- **Biotechnology**: My background also includes biotech, which lets me unite knowledge from the living world with digital technologies.
- **Project “Indego”**: This is my magnum opus—a grand attempt at building a holistic model of intelligence and consciousness that seamlessly integrates human, digital, and biological insights.
- **Software Engineering & Tooling**: I enjoy creating workflows, refining code structures, and writing about ways to optimize the developer experience.

```

### Why I’m Here on Medium

1. **Sharing Insights**: I want to publish deep-dives on AI, machine learning, biotech, and the philosophical aspects of merging human and artificial cognition.
2. **Community & Collaboration**: I love hearing from people with different backgrounds—exchanging ideas and building connections. My dream is to build an inclusive, global network of curious minds.
3. **Learning**: Medium is a treasure trove of knowledge. I’m constantly inspired by the intelligence and creativity of other authors here.

```

### Fun Facts & Unique Tidbits

- **No Limits Mindset**: I’m often told I tackle “impossible” tasks without blinking—pushing boundaries is a daily habit.
- **Passion for Detail**: I could talk for hours about code architecture or the nuance of neural net activations. My ADHD hyperfocus is as much a boon as it is an obsession.
- **Wit & Humor**: Despite all the technical complexities I navigate, I’ll always find time for a good laugh or a playful reference. Life’s better with humor!
- **Travel & Curiosity**: I love exploring new places—physically and intellectually. Every new destination or viewpoint expands my perspective and feeds my creative soul.

```

### Topics You'll See Me Write About

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Expect deep technical dives, best practices, plus philosophical musings about the future of digital minds.
- **Biotech & Emerging Technologies**: I enjoy discussing how biology and computing intersect and can inspire each other.
- **Tooling & Developer Productivity**: I have a knack for optimizing dev environments (shoutout to my swirling VSCODE Optimization Protocol!).
- **Ethics & Philosophy**: I’m driven to ensure that the next generation of AI/DI is built responsibly and reflects our highest shared values.

```

### Family, Pets, & Beyond

- **Supportive Circle**: My family and close friends have championed my out-of-the-box thinking from day one, and for that, I’m eternally grateful.
- **Pets**: I love animals—no personal zoo at the moment, but I can’t resist making new furry friends whenever possible.

```

### Medium Goals

1. **Build a Community**: I want this space to be a hub for curious minds—anyone who’s excited about pushing boundaries in AI, biotech, or beyond.
2. **Inspire Others**: Whether you’re new to coding or a seasoned researcher, I hope my stories spark ideas or, at least, a grin.
3. **Collaborate & Exchange**: I believe real innovation happens at the intersections, so I welcome constructive feedback and friendly debate.

```

### Where Else You Can Find Me

- **GitHub**: [github.com/Ace1928](https://github.com/Ace1928)
- **Email**: [ace1928@gmail.com](mailto:ace1928@gmail.com)
- **Twitter** (maybe?): If I do tweet, it’s usually about some new AI trick or random musings.

```

### Feel Free to Reach Out

- **Comments & Follows**: Drop a comment or follow if you’re working on something exciting, have questions, or just want to nerd out about the future of intelligence.
- **P.S.**: Don’t forget to pin your own About Me story if you decide to write one too!

### A Personal Note

I see **ADHD** and **autism** as lenses through which I perceive the world. They give me a unique vantage point—one where any challenge can be reimagined, and impossible only means we haven’t tried yet. My day-to-day might be coding elaborate neural network prototypes or brainstorming a new biotech synergy. But in my core, I’m just someone who genuinely loves to learn and wants to share that enthusiasm with others.

I hope we can learn from each other, laugh at the complexities of life together, and ultimately shape a more innovative, inclusive future. Let’s keep exploring, discovering, and doing the impossible.

Thank you for reading my story, and I look forward to connecting with you here on Medium!
