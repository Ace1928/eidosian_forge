## Chapter 5: The Social Experiment – From Preschool Mayhem to Early Primary Turbulence

### Part 1: The Spark of Curiosity – Electronics, Chemistry, and Magic

- **Introduction**: Before fully understanding human interaction, the author's mind was already ignited by the power of electronics and chemistry. These subjects were introduced early through Dad's tinkering experiments in their garage.
- **Early Reading**: By preschool age, he had read Harry Potter books that introduced him to realms where magic was real. He delved deeply into analyzing spells and potions with analytical fervor.

### Part 2: The Outlaw of Preschool – Mastering Physics the Hard Way

- **Exclusion from Preschool**: Due to his questioning nature, he was expelled from preschool for using physics to manipulate objects.
- **Academic Regime**: After expulsion, he spent a year under Mum's academic regime. This time isolated him further from social interactions.

### Part 3: A Glimmer of Friendship Amid Chaos

- **Best Friend**: He found a best friend who provided a sense of normalcy and friendship during his formative years.
- **Friendship’s Endurence**: Despite drifting apart over the years, that friendship remained cherished as one of few genuine connections.

### Part 4: Year One – The Outcast’s Awakening and the Great Escape

- **School Rejection**: In Grade 1, he was expelled from primary school due to bullying. He decided to leave for a new school (St Stephens) where he thrived despite his outsider status.
- **Enrollment at St Stephens**: Despite initial confusion and scrutiny, he found that the academic structure recognized his abilities.

### Part 5: The Paradox of Parental Paths – Mum’s Calculated Gambit

- **Mum's Decision to Teach**: Mum left teaching for a more stable career with a strategic plan to enter the Catholic system.
- **Relocation to St Stephens**: She sent him to St Stephens, where she taught and where he found himself ostracized.

### Part 6: The Aftermath and Lingering Shadows

- **Church Rejection**: His rejection from church was a mix of liberation (from strict conformity) and pain (silencing questions).
- **Final Reflections**: These turbulent years shaped his identity, awakening an independent spirit that would resist societal norms.
