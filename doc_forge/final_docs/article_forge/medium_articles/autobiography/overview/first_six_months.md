### File Summary

This file is part of an autobiographical series focusing on the first six months of life in Gladstone, Australia. It covers various aspects including the environment, family dynamics, economic struggles, and personal growth during this formative period.

### API Documentation

- **Chapter 1: Zero to Six Months**
  - Part 1: Arrival in the Furnace
    - "I was born in 1993 under the unyielding sun of Gladstone—a place where the heat wasn’t just weather, it was a relentless character in the story of your life."
  - Part 2: A Home Built on Chaos and Necessity
    - "Home wasn’t the warm, orderly nest one might dream of. With a mother whose moods swung like a wild pendulum—one moment nurturing, the next a storm of unpredictable chaos—I quickly learned that survival depended on self-reliance."
  - Part 3: The Absent Anchor – Dad’s Relentless Grind
    - "My father, the unsung hero of my earliest days, was perpetually torn between work and the remnants of family life. Dad’s schedule was a relentless grind; he worked like the world depended on him—which, in a way, it did."
  - Part 4: Culinary Economics and the Art of Fishing
    - "Money was tight, and survival demanded resourcefulness. I don’t remember the taste of my first meal, but Dad’s tales paint a vivid picture: after long days on the job, he’d set out with a fishing rod in hand, determined to catch dinner on a shoestring budget."
  - Part 5: The Exodus to Newcastle
    - "Around the time I hit the six-month mark, the winds of change blew in a new direction. We left the suffocating heat and unpredictable chaos of Gladstone for Newcastle, NSW—a move driven by Dad’s work and the need for a fresh start."
  - Part 6: A Hazy Beginning, a Clear Legacy
    - "I don’t have a full dossier on those earliest days. My memories are scattered like the fragments of a half-remembered dream: the oppressive heat of Gladstone, the chaotic cadence of home, and Dad’s determined return at every possible moment to keep me fed."
  - Chapter 2: Six to Twelve Months
    - "Stay tuned as we dive into the whirlwind of early mobility, the nascent sparks of curiosity and manipulation, and the first real taste of a life that would always demand more than just survival—it would demand mastery."
