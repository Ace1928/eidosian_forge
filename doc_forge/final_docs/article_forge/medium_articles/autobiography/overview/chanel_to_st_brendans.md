_Next Chapter Tease:_
**Chapter 8: The Reckoning – Years 9 and 10 at St Brendan’s**
As I settle into the next phase of my educational journey at St Brendan's, a school obsessed with football and music, the stage is set for further trials and triumphs. From navigating the treacherous social hierarchies to finding unexpected avenues of self-expression, the coming years will reveal just how far I can push back against a world that’s constantly trying to box me in.
