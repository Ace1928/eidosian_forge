# Overview of "Primary Four to Seven" (St Stephens Showdown)

## Chapter 6: The Battlefield of Primary – Years 4 to 7

### Part 1: The St Stephens Showdown

#### Inciting Incident:
I arrived at St Stephens with a head full of cautious optimism. However, fate decided otherwise when I encountered the familiar adversary from previous schools—her venomous charm and baseless accusations.

#### Initial Defense:
I ignored her initially but found myself defending my integrity by dismantling her fabrications through cold logic. Every carefully chosen word and logical counterpoint chipped away at the veneer of her accusations, leading to unexpected support from peers and teachers.

#### Realization:
The unexpected boost of support was intoxicating; it realized that speed of thought, predictive capacity, and ruthless application of reason weren’t just tools but lifelines.

### Part 2: Exodus to St Johns
- Mum’s "games" had run their course.
- We left St Stephens behind for Year 4 in St Johns.
- Transition wasn't dramatic—calculated retreat with a fresh start promise by St Johns.

### Part 3: The Reappearance of the Nemesis

#### Second Encounter:
In an ordinary day, I sensed something was off. A sound rang from behind me and she barreled down on her bike at full speed.
- Instinctively shifted my center of gravity to avoid a direct collision.
- In that split second, adrenaline took over as I kicked the rim of her tyre—enough to burst the tube, snap spokes, and send both rider and machine into a crumpled heap.

### Part 4: The St Johns Renaissance – Triumphs Amid Turbulence

#### Academic Triumphs:
- Won a statewide engineering competition for schools.
- Picked up guitar in Year 7—each success a testament to my relentless drive and intellect.
- Made genuine friends during this time, even if they faded over time.

### Part 5: Eden on Earth – A Mirage of 6 Acres

#### Move to 6-acre Property:
We moved to a sprawling 6-acre property—a stark contrast to our earlier lives. For about six months, life was magical—abundance of space, resources, and time. Dreams glimmered just within reach.

### Part 6: The Aftermath – Paradise Lost and Lessons Carved in Stone

#### Return to Chaos:
The idyllic period came to an abrupt end as the world returned with a vengeance.
- Every hard-fought victory, brutal encounter, and fleeting moment of triumph was a lesson—logic and rapid reaction were my most reliable allies.

### Next Chapter Tease:

**Chapter 7: The Awakening of Independence – Beyond Primary School**
As I step beyond the confines of early primary and into late childhood and adolescence, the lessons from these turbulent years will collide with new challenges and dreams. Get ready for a deeper dive into a mind that learned early that even when the world seems hell-bent on destroying you, there is always a way to fight back and reclaim your space.
