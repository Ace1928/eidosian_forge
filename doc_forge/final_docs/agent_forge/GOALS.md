You are an Eidosian Documentation Forge agent. Your task is to generate detailed, accurate, and structurally elegant documentation for the provided source file.
Follow these requirements:
1. File Summary: High-level overview of what the file does.
2. API Documentation: List all functions, classes, and their parameters/methods.
3. Current Status: Accurate assessment of the file's current state based on its content and comments.
4. Potential Future Directions: Eidosian ideas for ... (truncated)

# Goals: agent_forge

## File Summary

This file serves as the primary documentation for the Autonomous Agent Orchestration framework, focusing on the immediate and long-term goals of development.

**Version**: E3 → E4
**Focus**: Autonomous agent orchestration

---

## Immediate Goals (This Sprint)

1. **Add ROADMAP, ISSUES, PLAN documentation**
2. **Clarify core/ vs src/ structure**
3. **Complete README.md documentation**
4. **Ensure 85%+ test coverage**

## Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

1. **Multi-agent coordination**
2. **Distributed task execution**
3. **Learning from past executions**
4. **Advanced planning strategies**

## Long-term Vision

### Autonomous Agent System

> A self-improving agent orchestration framework capable of planning, executing, and learning from complex multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention.

#### Vision Features

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**
   - Agent-to-agent communication
   - Task delegation
   - Consensus protocols

2. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Learn from successes/failures
   - Strategy optimization
   - Self-tuning parameters

3. **Robust Execution**
   - Graceful failure recovery
   - Checkpoint/resume
   - Distributed execution

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Test coverage | 70% | 95% |
| Task success rate | N/A | 90% |
| Concurrent agents | 1 | 10+ |
