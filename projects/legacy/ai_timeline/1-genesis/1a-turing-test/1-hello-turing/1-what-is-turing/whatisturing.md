Python Module Overview: 1-what-is-turing-test.py
The 1-what-is-turing-test.py module is intended to be an interactive, educational script that simulates the Turing Test environment, allowing users to engage directly in the imitation game thought experiment proposed by Alan Turing. The Python module aims to be accessible, informative, and engaging, suitable for integration into a web-based educational platform or as a standalone interactive exercise. Below is a detailed plan for this module, designed to maximize user engagement and learning through interactive programming.

Objectives of the Python Module:
Educate users about the Turing Test and its significance.
Simulate the imitation game to allow users to experience the role of the interrogator, human, and machine.
Stimulate thought and discussion on the implications of machine intelligence.
Functional Specifications:
Interactive User Interface: Easy-to-use text-based interactions, guiding the user through the simulation of the Turing Test.
Role Selection: Users can choose to play as the interrogator, human, or machine, each with different strategies and objectives.
Dynamic Questioning and Response System: Depending on the role, the system will either generate questions (interrogator) or responses (human/machine) based on predefined logic and algorithms.
Scoring and Feedback Mechanism: After the completion of a session, provide feedback to the user based on their performance and decisions, offering insights and learning points.
