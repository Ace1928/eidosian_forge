## Key Terms
- Chinese Room: A thought-provoking, influential philosophical thought experiment proposed by John Searle to challenge the notion of strong AI and question the fundamental nature of understanding, intelligence, and the human mind. In this hypothetical scenario, a person who does not understand Chinese is locked in a room and given a set of detailed instructions for manipulating Chinese symbols in response to incoming messages. The central, perplexing question is whether the person in the room can be said to truly understand Chinese, or is merely simulating intelligent behavior through syntactic manipulation and symbol processing, without any genuine comprehension or grasp of meaning.
- Strong AI vs. Weak AI: Two contrasting, often polarizing philosophical positions on the nature, potential, and limitations of artificial intelligence. Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), refers to the ambitious, far-reaching idea that machines can be created that possess genuine understanding, consciousness, and intelligence comparable to or even surpassing that of humans, with the ability to reason, learn, and adapt across a wide range of domains and tasks. Weak AI, on the other hand, maintains a more modest, limited view, holding that AI systems merely simulate or approximate intelligent behavior without possessing true understanding, subjective experience, or conscious awareness, and are fundamentally limited to narrow, domain-specific applications and capabilities.
- Behaviorism: A influential psychological theory and framework that emphasizes the study of observable, measurable behavior and rejects the notion of internal mental states or processes as valid explanatory concepts or targets of scientific inquiry. Behaviorists argue that behavior is the key to understanding intelligence, cognition, and the workings of the mind, and that mental phenomena should be defined and analyzed solely in terms of observable inputs, outputs, and patterns of stimulus-response associations. In the context of the Turing Test and artificial intelligence, behaviorism suggests that if a machine can exhibit behavior that is functionally indistinguishable from that of a human, it should be considered intelligent and minded, regardless of its internal structure, mechanisms, or subjective experience.
- Functionalism: A influential philosophical theory of mind that holds that mental states and processes are defined by their functional roles, causal relationships, and patterns of interaction within a cognitive system, rather than by their specific physical, biological, or material properties and implementation details. Functionalists argue that what matters for intelligence, consciousness, and cognition is not the particular physical substrate or medium in which information processing takes place, but rather the abstract, high-level causal relations, computational structures, and information flow that give rise to intelligent behavior and experience. This view is often invoked to support the possibility and plausibility of machine intelligence and the validity and significance of the Turing Test as a meaningful criterion for assessing the mental capabilities of artificial systems.
- AI Ethics: The crucial, rapidly evolving branch of ethics and moral philosophy that examines the profound moral, social, and existential implications and challenges posed by the development, deployment, and increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence technologies in our lives and societies. AI ethics encompasses a wide range of complex, often controversial issues and considerations, including transparency, accountability, fairness, privacy, autonomy, trust, and the potential transformative impact of AI on human values, relationships, institutions, and well-being. As AI systems become ever more sophisticated, autonomous, and human-like in their capabilities and interactions, the ethical questions and dilemmas surrounding their creation, use, and governance become increasingly urgent and complex, demanding sustained, interdisciplinary reflection, public dialogue, and proactive policy responses to ensure the responsible, beneficial development of AI for the common good.
