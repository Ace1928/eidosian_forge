- **1966: The Pioneering Shakey the Robot** - Developed by researchers at the Stanford Research Institute, Shakey was one of the first general-purpose mobile robots capable of reasoning about its own actions. Using a novel combination of locomotion, perception, and problem-solving, it could navigate and manipulate objects in its environment, marking a significant milestone in the development of autonomous robotics.
