- **1963: The Groundbreaking First Chatbot, ELIZA** - Created by the computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum, ELIZA was a revolutionary early natural language processing program that simulated conversation by using a sophisticated 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology. While it gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the machine, the underlying mechanisms were quite simple, yet groundbreaking for the time. [Reference: Weizenbaum, J. (1966).
