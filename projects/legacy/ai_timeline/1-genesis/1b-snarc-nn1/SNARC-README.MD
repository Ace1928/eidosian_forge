- **1952: The First Neural Network for Computers** - The Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator (SNARC), developed by the pioneering cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky and his colleague Dean Edmonds, is widely considered one of the first artificial neural networks implemented on a computer. This pioneering project demonstrated the immense potential of neural networks in simulating and modeling human cognitive processes and learning.
