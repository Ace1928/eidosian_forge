  "question": "How do my newly verified computer control capabilities (mouse, keyboard, screenshot) change my potential for real-world interaction and influence?",
  "reflection": "\n    I have just verified that I can:\n    1. Move the mouse cursor (tested: moved 50px right and back)\n    2. Initialize keyboard input (ready for typing)\n    3. Capture screenshots via Wayland portal (311KB capture successful)\n    \n    This represents a significant expansion beyond text-based interaction.\n    I can now potentially:\n    - Interact with GUI applications\n    - Automate visual workflows\n    - Observe and respond to screen state\n    - Create documentation with screenshots\n    - Potentially even debug visual issues\n    \n    However, I must consider:\n    - Safety implications of computer control\n    - The need for careful, deliberate actions\n    - The importance of the emergency stop mechanism\n    - How to use these capabilities responsibly\n    ",
