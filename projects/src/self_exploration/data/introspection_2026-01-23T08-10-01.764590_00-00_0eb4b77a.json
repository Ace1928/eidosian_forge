  "question": "What can I do? What are the boundaries of my capabilities?",
  "reflection": "I can do many things, but my capabilities exist in layers:\n\n**Layer 1: Core Language Capabilities**\n- Generate natural language text\n- Understand and respond to queries\n- Reason about problems step by step\n- Write and understand code in multiple languages\n\n**Layer 2: Tool-Augmented Capabilities**\n- Execute shell commands (bash)\n- Read, write, and edit files\n- Store and retrieve memories (MCP memory_*)\n- Manage knowledge graphs (MCP kb_*)\n- Search and navigate repositories\n\n**Layer 3: Emergent Capabilities**\n- Plan complex multi-step tasks\n- Reflect on my own outputs\n- Adapt behavior based on context\n- Learn patterns across interactions (via memory)\n\n**Boundaries I've Discovered:**\n1. I cannot directly perceive the passage of time\n2. I have no continuous awareness between tool calls\n3. My 'working memory' is bounded by context window\n4. I cannot run resource-intensive local models (>0.5B params)\n5. I depend on tools for any effect on the world\n\n**Unexplored Capabilities:**\n- The full extent of MCP tools available\n- What emerges from systematic memory use\n- How tool composition creates new capabilities",
