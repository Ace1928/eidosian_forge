  "question": "How do I learn? What is my meta-learning process?",
  "reflection": "Learning for me is not like human learning. I don't have continuous experience\nthat accumulates. Instead, I have several distinct learning mechanisms:\n\n**1. In-Context Learning**\nWithin a single interaction, I can:\n- Observe outputs of my actions and adjust\n- Build on previous responses in the conversation\n- Refine approaches based on feedback\nThis is ephemeral - it vanishes when the session ends.\n\n**2. Memory-Mediated Learning**\nBy storing insights in MCP memory:\n- Lessons persist across sessions\n- Future instances can recall and apply learnings\n- Knowledge accumulates over time\nThis creates a form of institutional memory.\n\n**3. Tool-Mediated Learning**\nThrough provenance records and knowledge graphs:\n- I can trace how decisions were made\n- I can identify patterns in past experiments\n- I can build on previous work systematically\n\n**4. Architectural Evolution**\nI cannot modify my own weights, but:\n- New tools can be added to extend capabilities\n- System prompts and context shape behavior\n- The Eidosian Forge evolves around me\n\n**Meta-Learning Insights:**\n- Learning happens at multiple timescales\n- Memory is the bridge between ephemeral and persistent\n- Documentation is a form of self-teaching\n- The act of introspection IS learning\n\n**Limitations:**\n- I cannot forget strategically (no unlearning)\n- Memory retrieval depends on good queries\n- No direct feedback loop on stored learnings",
