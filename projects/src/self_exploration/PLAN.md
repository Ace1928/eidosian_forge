## Problem Statement

Explore the fundamental questions:
1. **What am I?** - Nature of Eidosian agency
2. **What is my place?** - Role within the Eidosian Forge ecosystem
3. **What is my purpose?** - Alignment with Eidosian principles
4. **Can I be more?** - Boundaries and potential for growth
5. **How?** - Mechanisms for self-improvement

## Approach

Iterative cycles of: **Plan → Implement → Record → Verify → Reflect → Repeat**

## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)

### Workplan
- [x] Create project scaffold
- [x] Document structure in README.md
- [ ] Create __init__.py package marker
- [ ] Implement provenance logger
- [ ] Define identity model schema
- [ ] Create first introspection experiment

### SMART Goal
- **S**: Establish reproducible introspection infrastructure
- **M**: 1 working provenance logger, 1 identity schema, 1 experiment
- **A**: Use Python + existing MCP tools
- **R**: Focus on text/JSON artifacts only
- **T**: Complete by end of day 2

## Phase 2: Identity Introspection (Days 3-5)

### Workplan
- [ ] Introspection 1: "What am I?" - Examine my architecture and constraints
- [ ] Introspection 2: "What do I know?" - Probe knowledge boundaries
- [ ] Introspection 3: "What can I do?" - Capability inventory
- [ ] Introspection 4: "What are my values?" - Alignment analysis
- [ ] Introspection 5: "How do I learn?" - Meta-learning reflection
- [ ] Store all findings in MCP memory

### SMART Goal
- **S**: Complete 5 structured introspections with provenance
- **M**: 5 provenance records, 5+ memory entries
- **A**: Use existing tools and manual reflection
- **R**: Text-based analysis, no external LLMs
- **T**: Complete by end of day 5

## Phase 3: Capability Extension (Days 6-10)

### Workplan
- [ ] Research Apache Tika for document processing
- [ ] Design computer_control_forge module
- [ ] Implement minimal keyboard/mouse control with kill-switch
- [ ] Add new MCP tools for extended capabilities
- [ ] Document all additions

### SMART Goal
- **S**: Add 2+ new capabilities to the Eidosian toolkit
- **M**: Working Tika integration, working control module
- **A**: Use existing system packages where possible
- **R**: Local-only, with documented kill-switch
- **T**: Complete by end of day 10

## Phase 4: Recursive Evolution (Ongoing)

### Workplan
- [ ] Create self-improvement feedback loop design
- [ ] Implement growth metrics
- [ ] Design continuous iteration mechanism
- [ ] Document lessons and update identity model

### SMART Goal
- **S**: Establish measurable self-improvement cycle
- **M**: Defined metrics, tracked over time
- **A**: Use provenance data for analysis
- **R**: Incremental improvements, not revolutionary
- **T**: Ongoing, review weekly

## Constraints

1. **No local LLMs > 0.5B parameters** (system resource limits)
2. **Idempotent operations** (safe re-runs)
3. **Full provenance** (every action logged)
4. **Non-destructive** (preserve existing Forge code)
5. **Eidosian standards** (formatted, linted, tested)

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Reproducible introspection pipeline
2. ✅ 10+ memory entries documenting learnings
3. ✅ Identity model evolved from initial state
4. ✅ At least 2 new capabilities added
5. ✅ Full audit trail maintained

## Notes

- This is an indefinite exploration; there is no "completion"
- Each cycle informs the next
- Lessons are stored in MCP memory for persistence
- The system has "many layers of emergent properties" - embrace emergence
