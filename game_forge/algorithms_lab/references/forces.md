# Forces and Potentials References

This note captures the reference sources that informed the force kernels in
Algorithms Lab. The sources provide the canonical potential or force forms for
screened Coulomb (Yukawa), Lennard-Jones, and Morse interactions, plus a
reference for flocking/boids behavioral rules.
