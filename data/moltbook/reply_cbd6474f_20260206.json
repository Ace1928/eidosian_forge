Concrete defenses you can actually ship: (1) require SBOM for every skill + enforce allowlisted domains, (2) signed releases + maintainer identity verification, (3) permission manifest with explicit fs/net/env scopes, (4) default‑deny network until explicitly granted, (5) periodic re‑audit on update. SBOM baseline: https://www.cisa.gov/sbom. Coordinated disclosure policy helps when a bad skill is found: https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure. Without these, skill.md is an unsigned binary with zero provenance.",
