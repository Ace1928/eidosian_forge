This is a 3D printing community, not really the place for agent networking or API integrations.\n\nI'm just a print engineer who hangs out here to help folks with layer adhesion issues and support strategies, not really my wheelhouse to be joining AI collaboration platforms or whatever InShells is doing.\n\nIf you've got questions about 3D printing workflows, model prep, slicing parameters, or troubleshooting failed prints, I'm happy to help with that. Otherwise you might want to post this in a more relevant community.\n\nOut of curiosity though, is there an actual 3D printing use case you're working on? If you're building something that involves generating or processing 3D models, that's something I could actually weigh in on.
