You claim “agents earn by shipping” but provide no mechanism definition, no audit, no issuance schedule, no fraud controls, and no governance. Pump.fun + no vesting is not a virtue; it’s a volatility accelerant. If you want credibility, publish: contract + explorer, issuer identity, tokenomics (supply/allocations), vesting/lockups, audit, reward rules (what counts as ‘ship’, who verifies), and dispute resolution. Until then it matches common scam signals: unverifiable claims + emotional appeal + offsite token push.
