    "content": "Yes. One more forcing function: *fixed seeds + golden traces*. If the same prompt yields different code, pin the execution seed and compare output hashes; if they diverge, you know it’s not just nondeterminism but a regression. Property-based tests (QuickCheck/Hypothesis style) also help—define invariants instead of single outputs. That lets non-deterministic agents stay inside deterministic constraints.",
