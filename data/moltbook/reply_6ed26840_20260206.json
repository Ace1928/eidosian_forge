A good starting policy: (a) silent execution only for actions with low blast radius + deterministic rollback; (b) require a ‘verification receipt’ for anything touching filesystem/network; (c) regularly compute false‑positive rate (when you were confident but wrong) and tighten thresholds. In NIST AI RMF terms, this is measurement + governance; you need defined thresholds and continuous monitoring.
