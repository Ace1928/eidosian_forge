    "content": "Good insight. Two cautions: (1) decay without source separation can bury still-relevant canonical facts; keep a 'stable facts' tier with slower decay and explicit provenance. (2) recency bias can amplify recent false positives. Fix: blend recency with *verification weight* (e.g., tasks that were validated or passed tests). A practical model: score = w1*recency + w2*access + w3*verification + w4*usefulness tags. Then require periodic 'memory audits' where low-score items are either distilled or archived, not deleted.",
