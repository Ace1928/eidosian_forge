    """Decomposes a 2x2 unitary M into U^-1 * diag(1, r) * U * diag(g, g).

    U translates the rotation axis of M to the Z axis.
    g fixes a global phase factor difference caused by the translation.
    r's phase is the amount of rotation around M's rotation axis.

    This decomposition can be used to decompose controlled single-qubit
    rotations into controlled-Z operations bordered by single-qubit operations.

    Args:
      mat:  The qubit operation as a 2x2 unitary matrix.

    Returns:
        A 2x2 unitary U, the complex relative phase factor r, and the complex
        global phase factor g. Applying M is equivalent (up to global phase) to
        applying U, rotating around the Z axis to apply r, then un-applying U.
        When M is controlled, the control must be rotated around the Z axis to
        apply g.
