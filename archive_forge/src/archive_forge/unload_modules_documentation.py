 Unload all modules that are in the target directory or in a subdirectory of it.
    It is necessary to unload modules before re-executing a script that imports the modules,
    so that the new version of the modules is loaded.
    The module unloading feature is extracted from Streamlit's LocalSourcesWatcher (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/blob/1.24.0/lib/streamlit/watcher/local_sources_watcher.py)
    and packaged as a standalone function.
