from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler

    Sampler that restricts data loading to a subset of
    the dataset for elastic training.

    It is especially useful in conjunction with
    :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. In such case, each
    process can pass a DistributedSampler instance as a DataLoader sampler,
    and load a subset of the original dataset that is exclusive to it.

    .. note::
        Dataset is assumed to be of constant size.

    Args:
        dataset: Dataset used for sampling.
        num_replicas (optional): Number of processes participating in
            distributed training.
        rank (optional): Rank of the current process within num_replicas.
        start_index (optional):  Which index of the dataset to start sampling from
