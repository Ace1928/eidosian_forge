def read_graph6(path):
    """Read simple undirected graphs in graph6 format from path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : file or string
       File or filename to write.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph or list of Graphs
       If the file contains multiple lines then a list of graphs is returned

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the string is unable to be parsed in graph6 format

    Examples
    --------
    You can read a graph6 file by giving the path to the file::

        >>> import tempfile
        >>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:
        ...     _ = f.write(b">>graph6<<A_\\n")
        ...     _ = f.seek(0)
        ...     G = nx.read_graph6(f.name)
        >>> list(G.edges())
        [(0, 1)]

    You can also read a graph6 file by giving an open file-like object::

        >>> import tempfile
        >>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
        ...     _ = f.write(b">>graph6<<A_\\n")
        ...     _ = f.seek(0)
        ...     G = nx.read_graph6(f)
        >>> list(G.edges())
        [(0, 1)]
