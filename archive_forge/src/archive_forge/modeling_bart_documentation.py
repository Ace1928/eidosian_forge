        Args:
            input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
                Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you
                provide it.

                Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
                [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

                [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
            attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

                - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
                - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

                [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
            encoder_hidden_states  (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
                Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention
                if the model is configured as a decoder.
            encoder_attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used
                in the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
            head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*):
                Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

                - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
                - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

            cross_attn_head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*):
                Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

                - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
                - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

            past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
                Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of
                shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of
                shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`. The two additional
                tensors are only required when the model is used as a decoder in a Sequence to Sequence model.

                Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the
                cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

                If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those
                that don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of
                all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
            labels (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ...,
                config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
                (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
            use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
                If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding
                (see `past_key_values`).

                - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
                - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
            output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under
                returned tensors for more detail.
            output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors
                for more detail.
            return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.

        Returns:

        Example:

        ```python
        >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, BartForCausalLM

        >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-base")
        >>> model = BartForCausalLM.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-base", add_cross_attention=False)
        >>> assert model.config.is_decoder, f"{model.__class__} has to be configured as a decoder."
        >>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
        >>> outputs = model(**inputs)

        >>> logits = outputs.logits
        >>> expected_shape = [1, inputs.input_ids.shape[-1], model.config.vocab_size]
        >>> list(logits.shape) == expected_shape
        True
        ```
