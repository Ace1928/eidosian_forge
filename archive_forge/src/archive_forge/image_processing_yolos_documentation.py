        Converts the raw output of [`YolosForObjectDetection`] into final bounding boxes in (top_left_x, top_left_y,
        bottom_right_x, bottom_right_y) format. Only supports PyTorch.

        Args:
            outputs ([`YolosObjectDetectionOutput`]):
                Raw outputs of the model.
            threshold (`float`, *optional*):
                Score threshold to keep object detection predictions.
            target_sizes (`torch.Tensor` or `List[Tuple[int, int]]`, *optional*):
                Tensor of shape `(batch_size, 2)` or list of tuples (`Tuple[int, int]`) containing the target size
                `(height, width)` of each image in the batch. If unset, predictions will not be resized.
        Returns:
            `List[Dict]`: A list of dictionaries, each dictionary containing the scores, labels and boxes for an image
            in the batch as predicted by the model.
