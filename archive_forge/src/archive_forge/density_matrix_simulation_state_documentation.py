Inits DensityMatrixSimulationState.

        Args:
            available_buffer: A workspace with the same shape and dtype as
                `target_tensor`. Used by operations that cannot be applied to
                `target_tensor` inline, in order to avoid unnecessary
                allocations.
            qubits: Determines the canonical ordering of the qubits. This
                is often used in specifying the initial state, i.e. the
                ordering of the computational basis states.
            prng: The pseudo random number generator to use for probabilistic
                effects.
            initial_state: The initial state for the simulation in the
                computational basis.
            dtype: The `numpy.dtype` of the inferred state vector. One of
                `numpy.complex64` or `numpy.complex128`. Only used when
                `target_tenson` is None.
            classical_data: The shared classical data container for this
                simulation.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If `initial_state` is provided as integer, but `qubits`
                is not provided.
