def create_tempfile(self, file_path=None, content=None, mode='w', encoding='utf8', errors='strict', cleanup=None):
    """Create a temporary file specific to the test.

    This creates a named file on disk that is isolated to this test, and will
    be properly cleaned up by the test. This avoids several pitfalls of
    creating temporary files for test purposes, as well as makes it easier
    to setup files, their data, read them back, and inspect them when
    a test fails. For example::

        def test_foo(self):
          output = self.create_tempfile()
          code_under_test(output)
          self.assertGreater(os.path.getsize(output), 0)
          self.assertEqual('foo', output.read_text())

    NOTE: This will zero-out the file. This ensures there is no pre-existing
    state.
    NOTE: If the file already exists, it will be made writable and overwritten.

    See also: :meth:`create_tempdir` for creating temporary directories, and
    ``_TempDir.create_file`` for creating files within a temporary directory.

    Args:
      file_path: Optional file path for the temp file. If not given, a unique
        file name will be generated and used. Slashes are allowed in the name;
        any missing intermediate directories will be created. NOTE: This path is
        the path that will be cleaned up, including any directories in the path,
        e.g., ``'foo/bar/baz.txt'`` will ``rm -r foo``.
      content: Optional string or
        bytes to initially write to the file. If not
        specified, then an empty file is created.
      mode: Mode string to use when writing content. Only used if `content` is
        non-empty.
      encoding: Encoding to use when writing string content. Only used if
        `content` is text.
      errors: How to handle text to bytes encoding errors. Only used if
        `content` is text.
      cleanup: Optional cleanup policy on when/if to remove the directory (and
        all its contents) at the end of the test. If None, then uses
        :attr:`tempfile_cleanup`.

    Returns:
      A _TempFile representing the created file; see _TempFile class docs for
      usage.
