Must be a positive number, or\n                special strings available to "log" and "date"\n                axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks\n                are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick\n                number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,\n                10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick\n                marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To\n                set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...\n                set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"\n                has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`\n                is a positive number, gives ticks linearly\n                spaced in value (but not position). For example\n                `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks\n                at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10\n                plus small digits between, use "D1" (all\n                digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is\n                ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`\n                is "date", then you must convert the time to\n                milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n                between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to\n                86400000.0. "date" also has special values\n                "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of\n                months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set\n                ticks on the 15th of every third month, set\n                `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To\n                set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"\n            gridcolor\n                Sets the color of the grid lines.\n            griddash\n                Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash\n                type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",\n                "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a\n                dash length list in px (eg "5px,10px,2px,2px").\n            gridwidth\n                Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n            nticks\n                Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n                particular axis. The actual number of ticks\n                will be chosen automatically to be less than or\n                equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if\n                `tickmode` is set to "auto".\n            showgrid\n                Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.\n                If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick\n                mark.\n            tick0\n                Sets the placement of the first tick on this\n                axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is\n                "log", then you must take the log of your\n                starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to\n                100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when\n                `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If\n                the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date\n                string, like date data. If the axis `type` is\n                "category", it should be a number, using the\n                scale where each category is assigned a serial\n                number from zero in the order it appears.\n            tickcolor\n                Sets the tick color.\n            ticklen\n                Sets the tick length (in px).\n            tickmode\n                Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",\n                the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If\n                "linear", the placement of the ticks is\n                determined by a starting position `tick0` and a\n                tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default\n                value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If\n                "array", the placement of the ticks is set via\n                `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.\n                ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is\n                provided).\n            ticks\n                Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If\n                "", this axis\' ticks are not drawn. If\n                "outside" ("inside"), this axis\' are drawn\n                outside (inside) the axis lines.\n            tickvals\n                Sets the values at which ticks on this axis\n                appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set\n                to "array". Used with `ticktext`.\n            tickvalssrc\n                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud\n                for `tickvals`.\n            tickwidth\n                Sets the tick width (in px).\n'), **kwargs)
