class TrainerCallback:
    """
    A class for objects that will inspect the state of the training loop at some events and take some decisions. At
    each of those events the following arguments are available:

    Args:
        args ([`TrainingArguments`]):
            The training arguments used to instantiate the [`Trainer`].
        state ([`TrainerState`]):
            The current state of the [`Trainer`].
        control ([`TrainerControl`]):
            The object that is returned to the [`Trainer`] and can be used to make some decisions.
        model ([`PreTrainedModel`] or `torch.nn.Module`):
            The model being trained.
        tokenizer ([`PreTrainedTokenizer`]):
            The tokenizer used for encoding the data.
        optimizer (`torch.optim.Optimizer`):
            The optimizer used for the training steps.
        lr_scheduler (`torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR`):
            The scheduler used for setting the learning rate.
        train_dataloader (`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, *optional*):
            The current dataloader used for training.
        eval_dataloader (`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, *optional*):
            The current dataloader used for training.
        metrics (`Dict[str, float]`):
            The metrics computed by the last evaluation phase.

            Those are only accessible in the event `on_evaluate`.
        logs  (`Dict[str, float]`):
            The values to log.

            Those are only accessible in the event `on_log`.

    The `control` object is the only one that can be changed by the callback, in which case the event that changes it
    should return the modified version.

    The argument `args`, `state` and `control` are positionals for all events, all the others are grouped in `kwargs`.
    You can unpack the ones you need in the signature of the event using them. As an example, see the code of the
    simple [`~transformers.PrinterCallback`].

    Example:

    ```python
    class PrinterCallback(TrainerCallback):
        def on_log(self, args, state, control, logs=None, **kwargs):
            _ = logs.pop("total_flos", None)
            if state.is_local_process_zero:
                print(logs)
    ```"""
