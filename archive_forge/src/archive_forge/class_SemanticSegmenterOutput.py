class SemanticSegmenterOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for outputs of semantic segmentation models.

    Args:
        loss (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` is provided):
            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) loss.
        logits (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, config.num_labels, logits_height, logits_width)`):
            Classification scores for each pixel.

            <Tip warning={true}>

            The logits returned do not necessarily have the same size as the `pixel_values` passed as inputs. This is
            to avoid doing two interpolations and lose some quality when a user needs to resize the logits to the
            original image size as post-processing. You should always check your logits shape and resize as needed.

            </Tip>

        hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, patch_size, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, patch_size,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
