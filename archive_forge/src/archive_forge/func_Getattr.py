    A Reduce object that represents the getattr operation. When unpickled, the
    Getattr will access an attribute 'name' of 'object' and return the value
    stored there. If the attribute doesn't exist, the default value will be
    returned if present.

    The following statements are equivalent:

    Getattr(collections, 'OrderedDict')
    Getattr(collections, 'spam', None)
    Getattr(*args)

    Reduce(getattr, (collections, 'OrderedDict'))
    Reduce(getattr, (collections, 'spam', None))
    Reduce(getattr, args)

    During unpickling, the first two will result in collections.OrderedDict and
    None respectively because the first attribute exists and the second one does
    not, forcing it to use the default value given in the third argument.
