    """
        Display data as an image, i.e., on a 2D regular raster.

        The input may either be actual RGB(A) data, or 2D scalar data, which
        will be rendered as a pseudocolor image. For displaying a grayscale
        image, set up the colormapping using the parameters
        ``cmap='gray', vmin=0, vmax=255``.

        The number of pixels used to render an image is set by the Axes size
        and the figure *dpi*. This can lead to aliasing artifacts when
        the image is resampled, because the displayed image size will usually
        not match the size of *X* (see
        :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_antialiasing`).
        The resampling can be controlled via the *interpolation* parameter
        and/or :rc:`image.interpolation`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like or PIL image
            The image data. Supported array shapes are:

            - (M, N): an image with scalar data. The values are mapped to
              colors using normalization and a colormap. See parameters *norm*,
              *cmap*, *vmin*, *vmax*.
            - (M, N, 3): an image with RGB values (0-1 float or 0-255 int).
            - (M, N, 4): an image with RGBA values (0-1 float or 0-255 int),
              i.e. including transparency.

            The first two dimensions (M, N) define the rows and columns of
            the image.

            Out-of-range RGB(A) values are clipped.

        %(cmap_doc)s

            This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).

        %(norm_doc)s

            This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).

        %(vmin_vmax_doc)s

            This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).

        aspect : {'equal', 'auto'} or float or None, default: None
            The aspect ratio of the Axes.  This parameter is particularly
            relevant for images since it determines whether data pixels are
            square.

            This parameter is a shortcut for explicitly calling
            `.Axes.set_aspect`. See there for further details.

            - 'equal': Ensures an aspect ratio of 1. Pixels will be square
              (unless pixel sizes are explicitly made non-square in data
              coordinates using *extent*).
            - 'auto': The Axes is kept fixed and the aspect is adjusted so
              that the data fit in the Axes. In general, this will result in
              non-square pixels.

            Normally, None (the default) means to use :rc:`image.aspect`.  However, if
            the image uses a transform that does not contain the axes data transform,
            then None means to not modify the axes aspect at all (in that case, directly
            call `.Axes.set_aspect` if desired).

        interpolation : str, default: :rc:`image.interpolation`
            The interpolation method used.

            Supported values are 'none', 'antialiased', 'nearest', 'bilinear',
            'bicubic', 'spline16', 'spline36', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite',
            'kaiser', 'quadric', 'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell',
            'sinc', 'lanczos', 'blackman'.

            The data *X* is resampled to the pixel size of the image on the
            figure canvas, using the interpolation method to either up- or
            downsample the data.

            If *interpolation* is 'none', then for the ps, pdf, and svg
            backends no down- or upsampling occurs, and the image data is
            passed to the backend as a native image.  Note that different ps,
            pdf, and svg viewers may display these raw pixels differently. On
            other backends, 'none' is the same as 'nearest'.

            If *interpolation* is the default 'antialiased', then 'nearest'
            interpolation is used if the image is upsampled by more than a
            factor of three (i.e. the number of display pixels is at least
            three times the size of the data array).  If the upsampling rate is
            smaller than 3, or the image is downsampled, then 'hanning'
            interpolation is used to act as an anti-aliasing filter, unless the
            image happens to be upsampled by exactly a factor of two or one.

            See
            :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods`
            for an overview of the supported interpolation methods, and
            :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_antialiasing` for
            a discussion of image antialiasing.

            Some interpolation methods require an additional radius parameter,
            which can be set by *filterrad*. Additionally, the antigrain image
            resize filter is controlled by the parameter *filternorm*.

        interpolation_stage : {'data', 'rgba'}, default: 'data'
            If 'data', interpolation
            is carried out on the data provided by the user.  If 'rgba', the
            interpolation is carried out after the colormapping has been
            applied (visual interpolation).

        alpha : float or array-like, optional
            The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).
            If *alpha* is an array, the alpha blending values are applied pixel
            by pixel, and *alpha* must have the same shape as *X*.

        origin : {'upper', 'lower'}, default: :rc:`image.origin`
            Place the [0, 0] index of the array in the upper left or lower
            left corner of the Axes. The convention (the default) 'upper' is
            typically used for matrices and images.

            Note that the vertical axis points upward for 'lower'
            but downward for 'upper'.

            See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for
            examples and a more detailed description.

        extent : floats (left, right, bottom, top), optional
            The bounding box in data coordinates that the image will fill.
            These values may be unitful and match the units of the Axes.
            The image is stretched individually along x and y to fill the box.

            The default extent is determined by the following conditions.
            Pixels have unit size in data coordinates. Their centers are on
            integer coordinates, and their center coordinates range from 0 to
            columns-1 horizontally and from 0 to rows-1 vertically.

            Note that the direction of the vertical axis and thus the default
            values for top and bottom depend on *origin*:

            - For ``origin == 'upper'`` the default is
              ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, numrows-0.5, -0.5)``.
            - For ``origin == 'lower'`` the default is
              ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, -0.5, numrows-0.5)``.

            See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for
            examples and a more detailed description.

        filternorm : bool, default: True
            A parameter for the antigrain image resize filter (see the
            antigrain documentation).  If *filternorm* is set, the filter
            normalizes integer values and corrects the rounding errors. It
            doesn't do anything with the source floating point values, it
            corrects only integers according to the rule of 1.0 which means
            that any sum of pixel weights must be equal to 1.0.  So, the
            filter function must produce a graph of the proper shape.

        filterrad : float > 0, default: 4.0
            The filter radius for filters that have a radius parameter, i.e.
            when interpolation is one of: 'sinc', 'lanczos' or 'blackman'.

        resample : bool, default: :rc:`image.resample`
            When *True*, use a full resampling method.  When *False*, only
            resample when the output image is larger than the input image.

        url : str, optional
            Set the url of the created `.AxesImage`. See `.Artist.set_url`.

        Returns
        -------
        `~matplotlib.image.AxesImage`

        Other Parameters
        ----------------
        data : indexable object, optional
            DATA_PARAMETER_PLACEHOLDER

        **kwargs : `~matplotlib.artist.Artist` properties
            These parameters are passed on to the constructor of the
            `.AxesImage` artist.

        Notes
        -----
        Unless *extent* is used, pixel centers will be located at integer
        coordinates. In other words: the origin will coincide with the center
        of pixel (0, 0).

        There are two common representations for RGB images with an alpha
        channel:

        -   Straight (unassociated) alpha: R, G, and B channels represent the
            color of the pixel, disregarding its opacity.
        -   Premultiplied (associated) alpha: R, G, and B channels represent
            the color of the pixel, adjusted for its opacity by multiplication.

        `~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` expects RGB images adopting the straight
        (unassociated) alpha representation.
