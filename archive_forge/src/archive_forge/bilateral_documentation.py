from ..._shared.utils import check_nD
from . import bilateral_cy
from .generic import _preprocess_input
Apply a flat kernel bilateral filter.

    This is an edge-preserving and noise reducing denoising filter. It averages
    pixels based on their spatial closeness and radiometric similarity.

    Spatial closeness is measured by considering only the local pixel
    neighborhood given by a footprint (structuring element).

    Radiometric similarity is defined by the graylevel interval [g-s0, g+s1]
    where g is the current pixel graylevel.

    Only pixels belonging to the footprint AND having a graylevel inside this
    interval are summed.

    Note that the sum may overflow depending on the data type of the input
    array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : 2-D array (uint8, uint16)
        Input image.
    footprint : 2-D array
        The neighborhood expressed as a 2-D array of 1's and 0's.
    out : 2-D array (same dtype as input)
        If None, a new array is allocated.
    mask : ndarray
        Mask array that defines (>0) area of the image included in the local
        neighborhood. If None, the complete image is used (default).
    shift_x, shift_y : int
        Offset added to the footprint center point. Shift is bounded to the
        footprint sizes (center must be inside the given footprint).
    s0, s1 : int
        Define the [s0, s1] interval around the grayvalue of the center pixel
        to be considered for computing the value.

    Returns
    -------
    out : 2-D array (same dtype as input image)
        Output image.
