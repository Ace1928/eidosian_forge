import warnings
This is now a no-op and can be safely removed from your code.

It used to enable the use of
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and
:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` when they were still
:term:`experimental`, but these estimators are now stable and can be imported
normally from `sklearn.ensemble`.
