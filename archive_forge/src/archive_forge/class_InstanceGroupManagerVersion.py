  Fields:
    instanceTemplate: The URL of the instance template that is specified for
      this managed instance group. The group uses this template to create new
      instances in the managed instance group until the `targetSize` for this
      version is reached. The templates for existing instances in the group do
      not change unless you run recreateInstances, run
      applyUpdatesToInstances, or set the group's updatePolicy.type to
      PROACTIVE; in those cases, existing instances are updated until the
      `targetSize` for this version is reached.
    name: Name of the version. Unique among all versions in the scope of this
      managed instance group.
    targetSize: Specifies the intended number of instances to be created from
      the instanceTemplate. The final number of instances created from the
      template will be equal to: - If expressed as a fixed number, the minimum
      of either targetSize.fixed or instanceGroupManager.targetSize is used. -
      if expressed as a percent, the targetSize would be
      (targetSize.percent/100 * InstanceGroupManager.targetSize) If there is a
      remainder, the number is rounded. If unset, this version will update any
      remaining instances not updated by another version. Read Starting a
      canary update for more information.
