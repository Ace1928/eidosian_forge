def _set_device_pixel_ratio(self, ratio):
    """
        Set the ratio of physical to logical pixels used for the canvas.

        Subclasses that support High DPI screens can set this property to
        indicate that said ratio is different. The canvas itself will be
        created at the physical size, while the client side will use the
        logical size. Thus the DPI of the Figure will change to be scaled by
        this ratio. Implementations that support High DPI screens should use
        physical pixels for events so that transforms back to Axes space are
        correct.

        By default, this is 1, meaning physical and logical pixels are the same
        size.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ratio : float
            The ratio of logical to physical pixels used for the canvas.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether the ratio has changed. Backends may interpret this as a
            signal to resize the window, repaint the canvas, or change any
            other relevant properties.
