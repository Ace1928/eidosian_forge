class BwaMemCommandline(AbstractCommandline):
    """Command line wrapper for Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA) mem.

    Run a BWA-MEM alignment, with single- or paired-end reads, equivalent to::

        $ bwa mem [...] <in.db.fasta> <in1.fq> <in2.fq> > <out.sam>

    See http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml for details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from Bio.Sequencing.Applications import BwaMemCommandline
    >>> reference_genome = "/path/to/reference_genome.fasta"
    >>> read_file = "/path/to/read_1.fq"
    >>> output_sam_file = "/path/to/output.sam"
    >>> align_cmd = BwaMemCommandline(reference=reference_genome, read_file1=read_file)
    >>> print(align_cmd)
    bwa mem /path/to/reference_genome.fasta /path/to/read_1.fq

    You would typically run the command line using align_cmd(stdout=output_sam_file)
    or via the Python subprocess module, as described in the Biopython tutorial.
