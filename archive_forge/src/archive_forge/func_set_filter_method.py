def set_filter_method(self, filter_method=None, **kwargs):

        Set the filtering method

        The filtering method controls aspects of which Kalman filtering
        approach will be used.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filter_method : int, optional
            Bitmask value to set the filter method to. See notes for details.
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments may be used to influence the filter method by
            setting individual boolean flags. See notes for details.

        Notes
        -----
        The filtering method is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        FILTER_CONVENTIONAL
            Conventional Kalman filter.
        FILTER_UNIVARIATE
            Univariate approach to Kalman filtering. Overrides conventional
            method if both are specified.
        FILTER_COLLAPSED
            Collapsed approach to Kalman filtering. Will be used *in addition*
            to conventional or univariate filtering.
        FILTER_CONCENTRATED
            Use the concentrated log-likelihood function. Will be used
            *in addition* to the other options.

        Note that only the first method is available if using a Scipy version
        older than 0.16.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `filter_method` argument, then
        the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the filter method may also be specified by directly modifying
        the class attributes which are defined similarly to the keyword
        arguments.

        The default filtering method is FILTER_CONVENTIONAL.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> mod = sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX(range(10))
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_method
        1
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_conventional
        True
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_univariate = True
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_method
        17
        >>> mod.ssm.set_filter_method(filter_univariate=False,
        ...                           filter_collapsed=True)
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_method
        33
        >>> mod.ssm.set_filter_method(filter_method=1)
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_conventional
        True
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_univariate
        False
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_collapsed
        False
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_univariate = True
        >>> mod.ssm.filter_method
