class CachedRepoInfo:
    """Frozen data structure holding information about a cached repository.

    Args:
        repo_id (`str`):
            Repo id of the repo on the Hub. Example: `"google/fleurs"`.
        repo_type (`Literal["dataset", "model", "space"]`):
            Type of the cached repo.
        repo_path (`Path`):
            Local path to the cached repo.
        size_on_disk (`int`):
            Sum of the blob file sizes in the cached repo.
        nb_files (`int`):
            Total number of blob files in the cached repo.
        revisions (`FrozenSet[CachedRevisionInfo]`):
            Set of [`~CachedRevisionInfo`] describing all revisions cached in the repo.
        last_accessed (`float`):
            Timestamp of the last time a blob file of the repo has been accessed.
        last_modified (`float`):
            Timestamp of the last time a blob file of the repo has been modified/created.

    <Tip warning={true}>

    `size_on_disk` is not necessarily the sum of all revisions sizes because of
    duplicated files. Besides, only blobs are taken into account, not the (negligible)
    size of folders and symlinks.

    </Tip>

    <Tip warning={true}>

    `last_accessed` and `last_modified` reliability can depend on the OS you are using.
    See [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result)
    for more details.
