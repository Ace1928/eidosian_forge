class CompositeMorphism(Morphism):
    """
    Represents a morphism which is a composition of other morphisms.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Two composite morphisms are equal if the morphisms they were
    obtained from (components) are the same and were listed in the
    same order.

    The arguments to the constructor for this class should be listed
    in diagram order: to obtain the composition `g\\circ f` from the
    instances of :class:`Morphism` ``g`` and ``f`` use
    ``CompositeMorphism(f, g)``.

    Examples
