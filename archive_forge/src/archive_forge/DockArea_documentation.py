        Restore Dock configuration as generated by saveState.
        
        This function does not create any Docks--it will only 
        restore the arrangement of an existing set of Docks.
        
        By default, docks that are described in *state* but do not exist
        in the dock area will cause an exception to be raised. This behavior
        can be changed by setting *missing* to 'ignore' or 'create'.
        
        Extra docks that are in the dockarea but that are not mentioned in
        *state* will be added to the bottom of the dockarea, unless otherwise
        specified by the *extra* argument.
