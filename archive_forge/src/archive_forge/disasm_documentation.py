        Factory class. You can't really instance a L{Disassembler} object,
        instead one of the adapter L{Engine} subclasses is returned.

        @type  arch: str
        @param arch: (Optional) Name of the processor architecture.
            If not provided the current processor architecture is assumed.
            For more details see L{win32.version._get_arch}.

        @type  engine: str
        @param engine: (Optional) Name of the disassembler engine.
            If not provided a compatible one is loaded automatically.
            See: L{Engine.name}

        @raise NotImplementedError: No compatible disassembler was found that
            could decode machine code for the requested architecture. This may
            be due to missing dependencies.

        @raise ValueError: An unknown engine name was supplied.
