    This context is used for compatibility in the case ``cloudpickle`` is not
    present on the running system. This permits to load functions defined in
    the ``main`` module, using proper safeguards. The declaration of the
    ``executor`` should be protected by ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` and the
    functions and variable used from main should be out of this block.

    This mimics the default behavior of multiprocessing under Windows and the
    behavior of the ``spawn`` start method on a posix system.
    For more details, see the end of the following section of python doc
