Assert that forward/inverse (along with jacobians) are inverses and finite.

  It is recommended to use x and y values that are very very close to the edge
  of the Bijector's domain.

  Args:
    bijector:  A Bijector instance.
    x:  np.array of values in the domain of bijector.forward.
    y:  np.array of values in the domain of bijector.inverse.
    event_ndims: Integer describing the number of event dimensions this bijector
      operates on.
    atol:  Absolute tolerance.
    rtol:  Relative tolerance.
    sess:  TensorFlow session.  Defaults to the default session.

  Raises:
    AssertionError:  If tests fail.
