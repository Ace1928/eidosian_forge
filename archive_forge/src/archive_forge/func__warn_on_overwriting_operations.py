    """
    Warn user when a list of operations is expected to overwrite itself in a single
    commit.

    Rules:
    - If a filepath is updated by multiple `CommitOperationAdd` operations, a warning
      message is triggered.
    - If a filepath is updated at least once by a `CommitOperationAdd` and then deleted
      by a `CommitOperationDelete`, a warning is triggered.
    - If a `CommitOperationDelete` deletes a filepath that is then updated by a
      `CommitOperationAdd`, no warning is triggered. This is usually useless (no need to
      delete before upload) but can happen if a user deletes an entire folder and then
      add new files to it.
