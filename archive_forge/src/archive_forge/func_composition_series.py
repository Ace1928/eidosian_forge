        Return the composition series for a group as a list
        of permutation groups.

        Explanation
        ===========

        The composition series for a group `G` is defined as a
        subnormal series `G = H_0 > H_1 > H_2 \\ldots` A composition
        series is a subnormal series such that each factor group
        `H(i+1) / H(i)` is simple.
        A subnormal series is a composition series only if it is of
        maximum length.

        The algorithm works as follows:
        Starting with the derived series the idea is to fill
        the gap between `G = der[i]` and `H = der[i+1]` for each
        `i` independently. Since, all subgroups of the abelian group
        `G/H` are normal so, first step is to take the generators
        `g` of `G` and add them to generators of `H` one by one.

        The factor groups formed are not simple in general. Each
        group is obtained from the previous one by adding one
        generator `g`, if the previous group is denoted by `H`
        then the next group `K` is generated by `g` and `H`.
        The factor group `K/H` is cyclic and it's order is
        `K.order()//G.order()`. The series is then extended between
        `K` and `H` by groups generated by powers of `g` and `H`.
        The series formed is then prepended to the already existing
        series.
