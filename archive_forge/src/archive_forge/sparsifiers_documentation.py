Add the edge {u, v} to the spanner H and take weight from
    the residual graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : NetworkX graph
        The spanner under construction.

    residual_graph : NetworkX graph
        The residual graph used by the Baswana-Sen algorithm. The weight
        for the edge is taken from this graph.

    u : node
        One endpoint of the edge.

    v : node
        The other endpoint of the edge.

    weight : object
        The edge attribute to use as distance.
