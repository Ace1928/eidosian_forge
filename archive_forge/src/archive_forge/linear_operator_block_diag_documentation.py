Solve single equation with best effort: `A X = rhs`.

    The returned `Tensor` will be close to an exact solution if `A` is well
    conditioned. Otherwise closeness will vary. See class docstring for details.

    Examples:

    ```python
    # Make an operator acting like batch matrix A.  Assume A.shape = [..., M, N]
    operator = LinearOperator(...)
    operator.shape = [..., M, N]

    # Solve one linear system for every member of the batch.
    RHS = ... # shape [..., M]

    X = operator.solvevec(RHS)
    # X is the solution to the linear system
    # sum_j A[..., :, j] X[..., j] = RHS[..., :]

    operator.matvec(X)
    ==> RHS
    ```

    Args:
      rhs: `Tensor` with same `dtype` as this operator, or list of `Tensor`s
        (for blockwise operators). `Tensor`s are treated as [batch] vectors,
        meaning for every set of leading dimensions, the last dimension defines
        a vector.  See class docstring for definition of compatibility regarding
        batch dimensions.
      adjoint: Python `bool`.  If `True`, solve the system involving the adjoint
        of this `LinearOperator`:  `A^H X = rhs`.
      name:  A name scope to use for ops added by this method.

    Returns:
      `Tensor` with shape `[...,N]` and same `dtype` as `rhs`.

    Raises:
      NotImplementedError:  If `self.is_non_singular` or `is_square` is False.
