from .config import InlineBackend
Set whether the inline backend closes all figures automatically or not.

    By default, the inline backend used in the IPython Notebook will close all
    matplotlib figures automatically after each cell is run. This means that
    plots in different cells won't interfere. Sometimes, you may want to make
    a plot in one cell and then refine it in later cells. This can be accomplished
    by::

        In [1]: set_matplotlib_close(False)

    To set this in your config files use the following::

        c.InlineBackend.close_figures = False

    Parameters
    ----------
    close : bool
        Should all matplotlib figures be automatically closed after each cell is
        run?
