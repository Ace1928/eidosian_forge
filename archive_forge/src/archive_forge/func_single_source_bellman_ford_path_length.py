def single_source_bellman_ford_path_length(G, source, weight='weight'):
    """Compute the shortest path length between source and all other
    reachable nodes for a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node label
        Starting node for path

    weight : string or function (default="weight")
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    length : dictionary
        Dictionary of shortest path length keyed by target

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> length = nx.single_source_bellman_ford_path_length(G, 0)
    >>> length[4]
    4
    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    ...     print(f"{node}: {length[node]}")
    0: 0
    1: 1
    2: 2
    3: 3
    4: 4

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.
