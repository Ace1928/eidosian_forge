from ._trustregion import (_minimize_trust_region)
from ._trlib import (get_trlib_quadratic_subproblem)

    Minimization of a scalar function of one or more variables using
    a nearly exact trust-region algorithm that only requires matrix
    vector products with the hessian matrix.

    Options
    -------
    inexact : bool, optional
        Accuracy to solve subproblems. If True requires less nonlinear
        iterations, but more vector products.
