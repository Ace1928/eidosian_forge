class Bra(State, BraBase):
    """A general time-independent Bra in quantum mechanics.

    Inherits from State and BraBase. A Bra is the dual of a Ket [1]_. This
    class and its subclasses will be the main classes that users will use for
    expressing Bras in Dirac notation.

    Parameters
    ==========

    args : tuple
        The list of numbers or parameters that uniquely specify the
        ket. This will usually be its symbol or its quantum numbers. For
        time-dependent state, this will include the time.

    Examples
    ========

    Create a simple Bra and look at its properties::

        >>> from sympy.physics.quantum import Bra
        >>> from sympy import symbols, I
        >>> b = Bra('psi')
        >>> b
        <psi|
        >>> b.hilbert_space
        H
        >>> b.is_commutative
        False

    Bra's know about their dual Ket's::

        >>> b.dual
        |psi>
        >>> b.dual_class()
        <class 'sympy.physics.quantum.state.Ket'>

    Like Kets, Bras can have compound labels and be manipulated in a similar
    manner::

        >>> n, m = symbols('n,m')
        >>> b = Bra(n,m) - I*Bra(m,n)
        >>> b
        -I*<mn| + <nm|

    Symbols in a Bra can be substituted using ``.subs``::

        >>> b.subs(n,m)
        <mm| - I*<mm|
