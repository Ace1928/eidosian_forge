    """Generate all the opcodes in a pickle.

    'pickle' is a file-like object, or string, containing the pickle.

    Each opcode in the pickle is generated, from the current pickle position,
    stopping after a STOP opcode is delivered.  A triple is generated for
    each opcode:

        opcode, arg, pos

    opcode is an OpcodeInfo record, describing the current opcode.

    If the opcode has an argument embedded in the pickle, arg is its decoded
    value, as a Python object.  If the opcode doesn't have an argument, arg
    is None.

    If the pickle has a tell() method, pos was the value of pickle.tell()
    before reading the current opcode.  If the pickle is a bytes object,
    it's wrapped in a BytesIO object, and the latter's tell() result is
    used.  Else (the pickle doesn't have a tell(), and it's not obvious how
    to query its current position) pos is None.
