        By default the cholesky_solve routine is used (method='CH'); other
        methods of matrix inversion can be used. To find out which are
        available, see the docstring of the .inv() method.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import SparseMatrix, Matrix, ones
        >>> A = Matrix([1, 2, 3])
        >>> B = Matrix([2, 3, 4])
        >>> S = SparseMatrix(A.row_join(B))
        >>> S
        Matrix([
        [1, 2],
        [2, 3],
        [3, 4]])

        If each line of S represent coefficients of Ax + By
        and x and y are [2, 3] then S*xy is:

        >>> r = S*Matrix([2, 3]); r
        Matrix([
        [ 8],
        [13],
        [18]])

        But let's add 1 to the middle value and then solve for the
        least-squares value of xy:

        >>> xy = S.solve_least_squares(Matrix([8, 14, 18])); xy
        Matrix([
        [ 5/3],
        [10/3]])

        The error is given by S*xy - r:

        >>> S*xy - r
        Matrix([
        [1/3],
        [1/3],
        [1/3]])
        >>> _.norm().n(2)
        0.58

        If a different xy is used, the norm will be higher:

        >>> xy += ones(2, 1)/10
        >>> (S*xy - r).norm().n(2)
        1.5
