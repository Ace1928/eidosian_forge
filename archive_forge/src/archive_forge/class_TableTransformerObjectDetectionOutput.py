    """
    Output type of [`TableTransformerForObjectDetection`].

    Args:
        loss (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `labels` are provided)):
            Total loss as a linear combination of a negative log-likehood (cross-entropy) for class prediction and a
            bounding box loss. The latter is defined as a linear combination of the L1 loss and the generalized
            scale-invariant IoU loss.
        loss_dict (`Dict`, *optional*):
            A dictionary containing the individual losses. Useful for logging.
        logits (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_queries, num_classes + 1)`):
            Classification logits (including no-object) for all queries.
        pred_boxes (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_queries, 4)`):
            Normalized boxes coordinates for all queries, represented as (center_x, center_y, width, height). These
            values are normalized in [0, 1], relative to the size of each individual image in the batch (disregarding
            possible padding). You can use [`~TableTransformerImageProcessor.post_process_object_detection`] to retrieve the
            unnormalized bounding boxes.
        auxiliary_outputs (`list[Dict]`, *optional*):
            Optional, only returned when auxilary losses are activated (i.e. `config.auxiliary_loss` is set to `True`)
            and labels are provided. It is a list of dictionaries containing the two above keys (`logits` and
            `pred_boxes`) for each decoder layer.
        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.
        decoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each
            layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        decoder_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the self-attention heads.
        cross_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax,
            used to compute the weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
        encoder_last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder of the model.
        encoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. Hidden-states of the encoder at the output of each
            layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        encoder_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the encoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the self-attention heads.
