class GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3ResponseMessage(_messages.Message):
    """Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational
  agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The
  approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is
  present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated, and
  the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the OutputAudioText
  responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the concatenated result is
  treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated as either text or SSML as
  appropriate. The agent designer should ideally use either text or SSML
  consistently throughout the bot design. * Otherwise, all Text responses are
  linearly concatenated, and the result is used for output audio synthesis.
  This approach allows for more sophisticated user experience scenarios, where
  the text displayed to the user may differ from what is heard.

  Enums:
    ResponseTypeValueValuesEnum: Response type.

  Messages:
    PayloadValue: Returns a response containing a custom, platform-specific
      payload.

  Fields:
    channel: The channel which the response is associated with. Clients can
      specify the channel via QueryParameters.channel, and only associated
      channel response will be returned.
    conversationSuccess: Indicates that the conversation succeeded.
    endInteraction: Output only. A signal that indicates the interaction with
      the Dialogflow agent has ended. This message is generated by Dialogflow
      only when the conversation reaches `END_SESSION` page. It is not
      supposed to be defined by the user. It's guaranteed that there is at
      most one such message in each response.
    knowledgeInfoCard: Represents info card for knowledge answers, to be
      better rendered in Dialogflow Messenger.
    liveAgentHandoff: Hands off conversation to a human agent.
    mixedAudio: Output only. An audio response message composed of both the
      synthesized Dialogflow agent responses and responses defined via
      play_audio. This message is generated by Dialogflow only and not
      supposed to be defined by the user.
    outputAudioText: A text or ssml response that is preferentially used for
      TTS output audio synthesis, as described in the comment on the
      ResponseMessage message.
    payload: Returns a response containing a custom, platform-specific
      payload.
    playAudio: Signal that the client should play an audio clip hosted at a
      client-specific URI. Dialogflow uses this to construct mixed_audio.
      However, Dialogflow itself does not try to read or process the URI in
      any way.
    responseType: Response type.
    telephonyTransferCall: A signal that the client should transfer the phone
      call connected to this agent to a third-party endpoint.
    text: Returns a text response.
