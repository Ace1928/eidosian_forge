    """Represents a InstantSnapshot resource. You can use instant snapshots to
  create disk rollback points quickly..

  Enums:
    ArchitectureValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The architecture of the instant
      snapshot. Valid values are ARM64 or X86_64.
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the instantSnapshot.
      This can be CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, or READY.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels to apply to this InstantSnapshot. These can be later
      modified by the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    architecture: [Output Only] The architecture of the instant snapshot.
      Valid values are ARM64 or X86_64.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    diskSizeGb: [Output Only] Size of the source disk, specified in GB.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#instantSnapshot
      for InstantSnapshot resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      InstantSnapshot, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a InstantSnapshot.
    labels: Labels to apply to this InstantSnapshot. These can be later
      modified by the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the instant snapshot
      resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It
      is not settable as a field in the request body.
    resourceStatus: [Output Only] Status information for the instant snapshot
      resource.
    satisfiesPzi: Output only. Reserved for future use.
    satisfiesPzs: [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource's
      resource id.
    sourceDisk: URL of the source disk used to create this instant snapshot.
      Note that the source disk must be in the same zone/region as the instant
      snapshot to be created. This can be a full or valid partial URL. For
      example, the following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
      /disks/disk -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region
      /disks/disk - projects/project/zones/zone/disks/disk -
      projects/project/regions/region/disks/disk - zones/zone/disks/disk -
      regions/region/disks/disk
    sourceDiskId: [Output Only] The ID value of the disk used to create this
      InstantSnapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the
      InstantSnapshot was taken from the current or a previous instance of a
      given disk name.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the instantSnapshot. This can be
      CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, or READY.
    zone: [Output Only] URL of the zone where the instant snapshot resides.
      You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
