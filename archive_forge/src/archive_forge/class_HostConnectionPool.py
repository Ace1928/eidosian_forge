class HostConnectionPool(object):
    """
    A pool of connections for one remote (host,port,is_secure).

    When connections are added to the pool, they are put into a
    pending queue.  The _mexe method returns connections to the pool
    before the response body has been read, so they connections aren't
    ready to send another request yet.  They stay in the pending queue
    until they are ready for another request, at which point they are
    returned to the pool of ready connections.

    The pool of ready connections is an ordered list of
    (connection,time) pairs, where the time is the time the connection
    was returned from _mexe.  After a certain period of time,
    connections are considered stale, and discarded rather than being
    reused.  This saves having to wait for the connection to time out
    if AWS has decided to close it on the other end because of
    inactivity.

    Thread Safety:

        This class is used only from ConnectionPool while it's mutex
        is held.

        There is a nice state diagram at the top of http_client.py.  It
        indicates that once the response headers have been read (which
        _mexe does before adding the connection to the pool), a
        response is attached to the connection, and it stays there
        until it's done reading.  This isn't entirely true: even after
        the client is done reading, the response may be closed, but
        not removed from the connection yet.
