    Returns a shape from varargs.

    In PyTorch, operations that accept shapes often accept them as varargs, like
    foo(*shape). However a user can pass the shape as a sequence of integers,
    like this:

      foo(1, 2, 3)

    or as a sequence of integers

      foo((1, 2, 3))

    In the first case shape will be a tuple of integers, and in the second case it's a tuple
    containing a tuple of integers. This validates those inputs and canonicalizes them
    to a tuple of integers.
