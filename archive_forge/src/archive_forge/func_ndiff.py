def ndiff(a, b, linejunk=None, charjunk=IS_CHARACTER_JUNK):
    """
    Compare `a` and `b` (lists of strings); return a `Differ`-style delta.

    Optional keyword parameters `linejunk` and `charjunk` are for filter
    functions, or can be None:

    - linejunk: A function that should accept a single string argument and
      return true iff the string is junk.  The default is None, and is
      recommended; the underlying SequenceMatcher class has an adaptive
      notion of "noise" lines.

    - charjunk: A function that accepts a character (string of length
      1), and returns true iff the character is junk. The default is
      the module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK, which filters out
      whitespace characters (a blank or tab; note: it's a bad idea to
      include newline in this!).

    Tools/scripts/ndiff.py is a command-line front-end to this function.

    Example:

    >>> diff = ndiff('one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n'.splitlines(keepends=True),
    ...              'ore\\ntree\\nemu\\n'.splitlines(keepends=True))
    >>> print(''.join(diff), end="")
    - one
    ?  ^
    + ore
    ?  ^
    - two
    - three
    ?  -
    + tree
    + emu

    return Differ(linejunk, charjunk).compare(a, b)
