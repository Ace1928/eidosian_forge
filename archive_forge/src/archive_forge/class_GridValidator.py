If you\n                provide a 2D `subplots` array, the length of\n                its longest row is used as the default. If you\n                give an `xaxes` array, its length is used as\n                the default. But it\'s also possible to have a\n                different length, if you want to leave a row at\n                the end for non-cartesian subplots.\n            domain\n                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.grid.Domain\n                ` instance or dict with compatible properties\n            pattern\n                If no `subplots`, `xaxes`, or `yaxes` are given\n                but we do have `rows` and `columns`, we can\n                generate defaults using consecutive axis IDs,\n                in two ways: "coupled" gives one x axis per\n                column and one y axis per row. "independent"\n                uses a new xy pair for each cell, left-to-right\n                across each row then iterating rows according\n                to `roworder`.\n            roworder\n                Is the first row the top or the bottom?

If you provide\n                a 2D `subplots` array or a `yaxes` array, its\n                length is used as the default. But it\'s also\n                possible to have a different length, if you\n                want to leave a row at the end for non-\n                cartesian subplots.\n            subplots\n                Used for freeform grids, where some axes may be\n                shared across subplots but others are not. Each\n                entry should be a cartesian subplot id, like\n                "xy" or "x3y2", or "" to leave that cell empty.\n                You may reuse x axes within the same column,\n                and y axes within the same row. Non-cartesian\n                subplots and traces that support `domain` can\n                place themselves in this grid separately using\n                the `gridcell` attribute.\n            xaxes\n                Used with `yaxes` when the x and y axes are\n                shared across columns and rows. Each entry\n                should be an x axis id like "x", "x2", etc., or\n                "" to not put an x axis in that column. Entries\n                other than "" must be unique.
