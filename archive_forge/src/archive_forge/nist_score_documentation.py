    Calculates the NIST length penalty, from Eq. 3 in Doddington (2002)

        penalty = exp( beta * log( min( len(hyp)/len(ref) , 1.0 )))

    where,

        `beta` is chosen to make the brevity penalty factor = 0.5 when the
        no. of words in the system output (hyp) is 2/3 of the average
        no. of words in the reference translation (ref)

    The NIST penalty is different from BLEU's such that it minimize the impact
    of the score of small variations in the length of a translation.
    See Fig. 4 in  Doddington (2002)
