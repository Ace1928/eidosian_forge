Invoke the callbacks that exist in the current scope (if any).

  If no callbacks are present in the current scope, this method returns
  immediately.

  Args:
    op_type: Type of the operation (e.g., "MatMul").
    inputs: Input tensors to the op. These are `EagerTensor`s in the case of
      eager execution of ops or `FuncGraph`s, and are non-eager `Tensor`s in the
      case of graph construction.
    attrs: Attributes of the op, as `tuple` of alternating keys and values.
    outputs: Output tensors from the op. These are `EagerTensor`s in the case of
      eager execution and are non-eager `Tensor`s in the case of graph
      construction.
    op_name: Name of the op. Applicable if and only if this method is invoked
      due to the graph construction of an op or the eager execution of a
      `FuncGraph`.
    graph: The graph involved (if any).
      - In the case if the eager execution of an op or FuncGraph, this is
        `None`.
      - In the case of the graph construction of an op, this is the `tf.Graph`
        object being built.

  Returns:
    `None`, or a `list` or `tuple` of output tenors that will override the
    original (input) `outputs`.
