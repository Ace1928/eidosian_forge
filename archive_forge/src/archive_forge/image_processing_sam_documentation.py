        Filters the predicted masks by selecting only the ones that meets several criteria. The first criterion being
        that the iou scores needs to be greater than `pred_iou_thresh`. The second criterion is that the stability
        score needs to be greater than `stability_score_thresh`. The method also converts the predicted masks to
        bounding boxes and pad the predicted masks if necessary.

        Args:
            masks (`tf.Tensor`):
                Input masks.
            iou_scores (`tf.Tensor`):
                List of IoU scores.
            original_size (`Tuple[int,int]`):
                Size of the orginal image.
            cropped_box_image (`np.array`):
                The cropped image.
            pred_iou_thresh (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.88):
                The threshold for the iou scores.
            stability_score_thresh (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.95):
                The threshold for the stability score.
            mask_threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
                The threshold for the predicted masks.
            stability_score_offset (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
                The offset for the stability score used in the `_compute_stability_score` method.
