Returns an undirected graph using the duplication-divergence model.

    A graph of `n` nodes is created by duplicating the initial nodes
    and retaining edges incident to the original nodes with a retention
    probability `p`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The desired number of nodes in the graph.
    p : float
        The probability for retaining the edge of the replicated node.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `p` is not a valid probability.
        If `n` is less than 2.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm appears in [1].

    This implementation disallows the possibility of generating
    disconnected graphs.
