Creates a signature for training and eval data.

  This function produces signatures that describe the inputs and outputs
  of a supervised process, such as training or evaluation, that
  results in loss, metrics, and the like. Note that this function only requires
  inputs to be not None.

  Args:
    method_name: Method name of the SignatureDef as a string.
    inputs: dict of string to `Tensor`.
    loss: dict of string to `Tensor` representing computed loss.
    predictions: dict of string to `Tensor` representing the output predictions.
    metrics: dict of string to `Tensor` representing metric ops.

  Returns:
    A train- or eval-flavored signature_def.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If inputs or outputs is `None`.
