apply an autoregressive filter to a series x

    x can be 2d, a can be 1d, 2d, or 3d

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        data array, 1d or 2d, if 2d then observations in rows
    a : array_like
        autoregressive filter coefficients, ar lag polynomial
        see Notes

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray, 2d
        filtered array, number of columns determined by x and a

    Notes
    -----

    In general form this uses the linear filter ::

        y = a(L)x

    where
    x : nobs, nvars
    a : nlags, nvars, npoly

    Depending on the shape and dimension of a this uses different
    Lag polynomial arrays

    case 1 : a is 1d or (nlags,1)
        one lag polynomial is applied to all variables (columns of x)
    case 2 : a is 2d, (nlags, nvars)
        each series is independently filtered with its own
        lag polynomial, uses loop over nvar
    case 3 : a is 3d, (nlags, nvars, npoly)
        the ith column of the output array is given by the linear filter
        defined by the 2d array a[:,:,i], i.e. ::

            y[:,i] = a(.,.,i)(L) * x
            y[t,i] = sum_p sum_j a(p,j,i)*x(t-p,j)
                     for p = 0,...nlags-1, j = 0,...nvars-1,
                     for all t >= nlags


    Note: maybe convert to axis=1, Not
