def current_effective_deadline() -> float:
    """Returns the current effective deadline for the current task.

    This function examines all the cancellation scopes that are currently in
    effect (taking into account shielding), and returns the deadline that will
    expire first.

    One example of where this might be is useful is if your code is trying to
    decide whether to begin an expensive operation like an RPC call, but wants
    to skip it if it knows that it can't possibly complete in the available
    time. Another example would be if you're using a protocol like gRPC that
    `propagates timeout information to the remote peer
    <http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#deadlines>`__; this function
    gives a way to fetch that information so you can send it along.

    If this is called in a context where a cancellation is currently active
    (i.e., a blocking call will immediately raise :exc:`Cancelled`), then
    returned deadline is ``-inf``. If it is called in a context where no
    scopes have a deadline set, it returns ``inf``.

    Returns:
        float: the effective deadline, as an absolute time.
