    Creates a ScalarFunction object for use with scalar minimizers
    (BFGS/LBFGSB/SLSQP/TNC/CG/etc).

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        The objective function to be minimized.

            ``fun(x, *args) -> float``

        where ``x`` is an 1-D array with shape (n,) and ``args``
        is a tuple of the fixed parameters needed to completely
        specify the function.
    x0 : ndarray, shape (n,)
        Initial guess. Array of real elements of size (n,),
        where 'n' is the number of independent variables.
    jac : {callable,  '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', None}, optional
        Method for computing the gradient vector. If it is a callable, it
        should be a function that returns the gradient vector:

            ``jac(x, *args) -> array_like, shape (n,)``

        If one of `{'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'}` is selected then the gradient
        is calculated with a relative step for finite differences. If `None`,
        then two-point finite differences with an absolute step is used.
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments passed to the objective function and its
        derivatives (`fun`, `jac` functions).
    bounds : sequence, optional
        Bounds on variables. 'new-style' bounds are required.
    eps : float or ndarray
        If `jac is None` the absolute step size used for numerical
        approximation of the jacobian via forward differences.
    finite_diff_rel_step : None or array_like, optional
        If `jac in ['2-point', '3-point', 'cs']` the relative step size to
        use for numerical approximation of the jacobian. The absolute step
        size is computed as ``h = rel_step * sign(x0) * max(1, abs(x0))``,
        possibly adjusted to fit into the bounds. For ``jac='3-point'``
        the sign of `h` is ignored. If None (default) then step is selected
        automatically.
    hess : {callable,  '2-point', '3-point', 'cs', None}
        Computes the Hessian matrix. If it is callable, it should return the
        Hessian matrix:

            ``hess(x, *args) -> {LinearOperator, spmatrix, array}, (n, n)``

        Alternatively, the keywords {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} select a
        finite difference scheme for numerical estimation.
        Whenever the gradient is estimated via finite-differences, the Hessian
        cannot be estimated with options {'2-point', '3-point', 'cs'} and needs
        to be estimated using one of the quasi-Newton strategies.
