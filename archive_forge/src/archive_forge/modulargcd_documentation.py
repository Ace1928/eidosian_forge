    Compute the GCD of two polynomials `f` and `g` in
    `\mathbb Q(\alpha)[x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}]` using a modular algorithm.

    The algorithm first computes the primitive associate
    `\check m_{\alpha}(z)` of the minimal polynomial `m_{\alpha}` in
    `\mathbb{Z}[z]` and the primitive associates of `f` and `g` in
    `\mathbb{Z}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}][z]/(\check m_{\alpha})[x_0]`. Then it
    computes the GCD in
    `\mathbb Q(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})[z]/(m_{\alpha}(z))[x_0]`.
    This is done by calculating the GCD in
    `\mathbb{Z}_p(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})[z]/(\check m_{\alpha}(z))[x_0]` for
    suitable primes `p` and then reconstructing the coefficients with the
    Chinese Remainder Theorem and Rational Reconstuction. The GCD over
    `\mathbb{Z}_p(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})[z]/(\check m_{\alpha}(z))[x_0]` is
    computed with a recursive subroutine, which evaluates the polynomials at
    `x_{n-1} = a` for suitable evaluation points `a \in \mathbb Z_p` and
    then calls itself recursively until the ground domain does no longer
    contain any parameters. For
    `\mathbb{Z}_p[z]/(\check m_{\alpha}(z))[x_0]` the Euclidean Algorithm is
    used. The results of those recursive calls are then interpolated and
    Rational Function Reconstruction is used to obtain the correct
    coefficients. The results, both in
    `\mathbb Q(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})[z]/(m_{\alpha}(z))[x_0]` and
    `\mathbb{Z}_p(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})[z]/(\check m_{\alpha}(z))[x_0]`, are
    verified by a fraction free trial division.

    Apart from the above GCD computation some GCDs in
    `\mathbb Q(\alpha)[x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}]` have to be calculated,
    because treating the polynomials as univariate ones can result in
    a spurious content of the GCD. For this ``func_field_modgcd`` is
    called recursively.
