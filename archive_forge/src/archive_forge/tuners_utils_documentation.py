        Delete an adapter from the layer

        This should be called on all adapter layers, or else we will get an inconsistent state.

        This method will also set a new active adapter if the deleted adapter was an active adapter. It is important
        that the new adapter is chosen in a deterministic way, so that the same adapter is chosen on all layers.

        Args:
            adapter_name (`str`): The name of the adapter to delete
