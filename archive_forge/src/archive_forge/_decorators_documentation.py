We want to collect all DecFunc instances that exist as
        attributes in the namespace of the class (a BaseModel or dataclass)
        that called us
        But we want to collect these in the order of the bases
        So instead of getting them all from the leaf class (the class that called us),
        we traverse the bases from root (the oldest ancestor class) to leaf
        and collect all of the instances as we go, taking care to replace
        any duplicate ones with the last one we see to mimic how function overriding
        works with inheritance.
        If we do replace any functions we put the replacement into the position
        the replaced function was in; that is, we maintain the order.
