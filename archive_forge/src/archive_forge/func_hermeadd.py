def hermeadd(c1, c2):
    """
    Add one Hermite series to another.

    Returns the sum of two Hermite series `c1` + `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to
    highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Array representing the Hermite series of their sum.

    See Also
    --------
    hermesub, hermemulx, hermemul, hermediv, hermepow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Hermite series
    is a Hermite series (without having to "reproject" the result onto
    the basis set) so addition, just like that of "standard" polynomials,
    is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeadd
    >>> hermeadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
    array([2.,  4.,  6.,  4.])
