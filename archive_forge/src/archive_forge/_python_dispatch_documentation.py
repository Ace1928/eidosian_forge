    This function should be used by wrapper tensor ``__torch_dispatch__`` subclasses
    that would like to work with torch.compile. It ensures that the subclass
    properly implements the aliasing behavior of every op,
    which is needed for correctness in AOTAutograd.
    This function will handle:

        * When we see a view op, we will alias the storages of any
          input and output tensor subclasses

        * When we see an inplace or out= op, we will directly
          return the corresponding input tensor, instead of returning
          a (potentially) fresh output tensor.
