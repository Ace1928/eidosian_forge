Computes Spatio-Temporal Reduced Reference Entropic Differencing (ST-RRED) Index. [#f1]_

    Both video inputs are compared over frame differences, with quality determined by
    differences in the entropy per subband.

    Parameters
    ----------
    referenceVideoData : ndarray
        Reference video, ndarray of dimension (T, M, N, C), (T, M, N), (M, N, C), or (M, N),
        where T is the number of frames, M is the height, N is width,
        and C is number of channels. Here C is only allowed to be 1.

    distortedVideoData : ndarray
        Distorted video, ndarray of dimension (T, M, N, C), (T, M, N), (M, N, C), or (M, N),
        where T is the number of frames, M is the height, N is width,
        and C is number of channels. Here C is only allowed to be 1.

    Returns
    -------
    strred_array : ndarray
        The ST-RRED results, ndarray of dimension ((T-1)/2, 4), where T
        is the number of frames.  Each row holds spatial score, temporal score, 
        reduced reference spatial score, and reduced reference temporal score.

    strred : float
        The final ST-RRED score if all blocks are averaged after comparing 
        reference and distorted data. This is close to full-reference.

    strredssn : float
        The final ST-RRED score if all blocks are averaged before comparing 
        reference and distorted data. This is the reduced reference score.
