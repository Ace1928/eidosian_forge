class BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndIntermediateActivations(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs that also contains a pooling of the last hidden states as well as intermediate
    activations that can be used by the model at later stages.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        pooler_output (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`):
            Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) after further processing
            through the layers used for the auxiliary pretraining task. E.g. for BERT-family of models, this returns
            the classification token after processing through a linear layer and a tanh activation function. The linear
            layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.
        hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
        intermediate_activations (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*):
            Intermediate activations that can be used to compute hidden states of the model at various layers.
