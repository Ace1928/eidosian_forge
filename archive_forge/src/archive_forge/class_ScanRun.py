    """A ScanRun is a output-only resource representing an actual run of the
  scan. Next id: 12

  Enums:
    ExecutionStateValueValuesEnum: The execution state of the ScanRun.
    ResultStateValueValuesEnum: The result state of the ScanRun. This field is
      only available after the execution state reaches "FINISHED".

  Fields:
    endTime: The time at which the ScanRun reached termination state - that
      the ScanRun is either finished or stopped by user.
    errorTrace: If result_state is an ERROR, this field provides the primary
      reason for scan's termination and more details, if such are available.
    executionState: The execution state of the ScanRun.
    hasVulnerabilities: Whether the scan run has found any vulnerabilities.
    name: The resource name of the ScanRun. The name follows the format of
      'projects/{projectId}/scanConfigs/{scanConfigId}/scanRuns/{scanRunId}'.
      The ScanRun IDs are generated by the system.
    progressPercent: The percentage of total completion ranging from 0 to 100.
      If the scan is in queue, the value is 0. If the scan is running, the
      value ranges from 0 to 100. If the scan is finished, the value is 100.
    resultState: The result state of the ScanRun. This field is only available
      after the execution state reaches "FINISHED".
    startTime: The time at which the ScanRun started.
    urlsCrawledCount: The number of URLs crawled during this ScanRun. If the
      scan is in progress, the value represents the number of URLs crawled up
      to now.
    urlsTestedCount: The number of URLs tested during this ScanRun. If the
      scan is in progress, the value represents the number of URLs tested up
      to now. The number of URLs tested is usually larger than the number URLS
      crawled because typically a crawled URL is tested with multiple test
      payloads.
    warningTraces: A list of warnings, if such are encountered during this
      scan run.
