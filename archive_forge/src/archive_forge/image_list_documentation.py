from torch import Tensor

    Structure that holds a list of images (of possibly
    varying sizes) as a single tensor.
    This works by padding the images to the same size,
    and storing in a field the original sizes of each image

    Args:
        tensors (tensor): Tensor containing images.
        image_sizes (list[tuple[int, int]]): List of Tuples each containing size of images.
