Returns `model_fn._TPUEstimatorSpec` that a model_fn can return.

    Args:
      features: Input `dict` mapping string feature names to `Tensor` or
        `SparseTensor` objects containing the values for that feature in a
        minibatch. Often to be used to fetch example-weight tensor.
      mode: Estimator's `ModeKeys`.
      logits: Logits `Tensor` to be used by the head.
      labels: Labels `Tensor`, or `dict` mapping string label names to `Tensor`
        objects of the label values.
      optimizer: An `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` instance to optimize the
        loss in TRAIN mode. Namely, sets `train_op = optimizer.get_updates(loss,
        trainable_variables)`, which updates variables to minimize `loss`.
      trainable_variables: A list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to
        minimize `loss`. In Tensorflow 1.x, by default these are the list of
        variables collected in the graph under the key
        `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`. As Tensorflow 2.x doesn't have
        collections and GraphKeys, trainable_variables need to be passed
        explicitly here.
      train_op_fn: Function that takes a scalar loss `Tensor` and returns an op
        to optimize the model with the loss in TRAIN mode. Used if `optimizer`
        is `None`. Exactly one of `train_op_fn` and `optimizer` must be set in
        TRAIN mode. By default, it is `None` in other modes. If you want to
        optimize loss yourself, you can pass `lambda _: tf.no_op()` and then use
          `EstimatorSpec.loss` to compute and apply gradients.
      update_ops: A list or tuple of update ops to be run at training time. For
        example, layers such as BatchNormalization create mean and variance
        update ops that need to be run at training time. In Tensorflow 1.x,
        these are thrown into an UPDATE_OPS collection. As Tensorflow 2.x
        doesn't have collections, update_ops need to be passed explicitly here.
      regularization_losses: A list of additional scalar losses to be added to
        the training loss, such as regularization losses.

    Returns:
      A `model_fn._TPUEstimatorSpec' instance.
