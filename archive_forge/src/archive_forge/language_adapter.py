"""
**1.10 Language Adapter Module (`language_adapter.py`):**
- **Purpose:** This module has been intricately engineered to facilitate the adaptation of various system modules to support multiple programming languages, thereby ensuring seamless integration and consistent functionality across a diverse array of coding environments. It acts as an essential component in preserving the system's flexibility and adaptability, enabling the extension of module capabilities to encompass a wide spectrum of programming languages with unparalleled precision and reliability.
- **Functions:**
  - `adapt_script_to_target_language(script_content: str, target_language: str) -> dict`: This function accepts the content of a script and a target programming language as inputs. It conducts a thorough analysis and adaptation of the script's parsing and segmentation processes to conform precisely to the syntactic and semantic requisites of the specified programming language. The adaptation process is executed with meticulous attention to detail and precision, ensuring that the script's structure and elements are impeccably tailored to fit the paradigms of the target language. The function returns a dictionary encapsulating the adapted script components, with each adaptation being explicitly documented and traceable. This function is pivotal in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the script across varied programming environments, thereby enhancing the system's robustness and versatility.
