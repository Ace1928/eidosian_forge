Must be a positive number, or\n                special strings available to "log" and "date"\n                axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks\n                are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick\n                number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,\n                10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick\n                marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To\n                set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...\n                set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"\n                has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`\n                is a positive number, gives ticks linearly\n                spaced in value (but not position). For example\n                `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks\n                at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10\n                plus small digits between, use "D1" (all\n                digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is\n                ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`\n                is "date", then you must convert the time to\n                milliseconds. For example, to set the interval\n                between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to\n                86400000.0. "date" also has special values\n                "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of\n                months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set\n                ticks on the 15th of every third month, set\n                `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To\n                set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"\n            exponentformat\n                Determines a formatting rule for the tick\n                exponents. For example, consider the number\n                1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as\n                1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If\n                "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If\n                "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.\n            labelalias\n                Replacement text for specific tick or hover\n                labels. For example using {US: \'USA\', CA:\n                \'Canada\'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.\n                The labels we would have shown must match the\n                keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or\n                ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign\n                symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular\n                ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n                instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any\n                axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values\n                (if desired) can include html-like tags or\n                MathJax.\n            minexponent\n                Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this\n                number. This only has an effect when\n                `tickformat` is "SI" or "B".\n            nticks\n                Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the\n                particular axis. The actual number of ticks\n                will be chosen automatically to be less than or\n                equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if\n                `tickmode` is set to "auto".\n            range\n                Sets the range of this axis.\n            separatethousands\n                If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated\n            showexponent\n                If "all", all exponents are shown besides their\n                significands. If "first", only the exponent of\n                the first tick is shown. If "last", only the\n                exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",\n                no exponents appear.\n            showticklabels\n                Determines whether or not the tick labels are\n                drawn.\n            showtickprefix\n                If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a\n                prefix. If "first", only the first tick is\n                displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the\n                last tick is displayed with a suffix. If\n                "none", tick prefixes are hidden.\n            showticksuffix\n                Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n            tick0\n                Sets the placement of the first tick on this\n                axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is\n                "log", then you must take the log of your\n                starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to\n                100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when\n                `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If\n                the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date\n                string, like date data. If the axis `type` is\n                "category", it should be a number, using the\n                scale where each category is assigned a serial\n                number from zero in the order it appears.\n            tickangle\n                Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect\n                to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`\n                of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.\n            tickcolor\n                Sets the tick color.\n            tickfont\n                Sets the color bar\'s tick label font\n            tickformat\n                Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3\n                formatting mini-languages which are very\n                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h\n                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-\n                format. And for dates see:\n                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two\n                items to d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of\n                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"\n                for fractional seconds with n digits. For\n                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with\n                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display\n                "09~15~23.46"\n            tickformatstops\n                A tuple of :class:`plotly.graph_objects.indicat\n                or.gauge.axis.Tickformatstop` instances or\n                dicts with compatible properties\n            tickformatstopdefaults\n                When used in a template (as layout.template.dat\n                a.indicator.gauge.axis.tickformatstopdefaults),\n                sets the default property values to use for\n                elements of\n                indicator.gauge.axis.tickformatstops\n            ticklabelstep\n                Sets the spacing between tick labels as\n                compared to the spacing between ticks. A value\n                of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A\n                value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A\n                larger value n means only every nth tick is\n                labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are\n                shown. Not implemented for axes with `type`\n                "log" or "multicategory", or when `tickmode` is\n                "array".\n            ticklen\n                Sets the tick length (in px).\n            tickmode\n                Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",\n                the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If\n                "linear", the placement of the ticks is\n                determined by a starting position `tick0` and a\n                tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default\n                value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If\n                "array", the placement of the ticks is set via\n                `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.\n                ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is\n                provided).\n            tickprefix\n                Sets a tick label prefix.\n            ticks\n                Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If\n                "", this axis\' ticks are not drawn. If\n                "outside" ("inside"), this axis\' are drawn\n                outside (inside) the axis lines.\n            ticksuffix\n                Sets a tick label suffix.\n            ticktext\n                Sets the text displayed at the ticks position\n                via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if\n                `tickmode` is set to "array".
