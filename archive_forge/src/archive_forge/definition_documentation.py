Non-Null Modifier

    A non-null is a kind of type marker, a wrapping type which points to another type. Non-null types enforce that their values are never null
    and can ensure an error is raised if this ever occurs during a request. It is useful for fields which you can make a strong guarantee on
    non-nullability, for example usually the id field of a database row will never be null.

    Example:

        class RowType(GraphQLObjectType):
            name = 'Row'
            fields = {
                'id': GraphQLField(type=GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString()))
            }

    Note: the enforcement of non-nullability occurs within the executor.
