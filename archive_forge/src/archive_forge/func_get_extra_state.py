    """Return any extra state to include in the module's state_dict.

        Implement this and a corresponding :func:`set_extra_state` for your module
        if you need to store extra state. This function is called when building the
        module's `state_dict()`.

        Note that extra state should be picklable to ensure working serialization
        of the state_dict. We only provide provide backwards compatibility guarantees
        for serializing Tensors; other objects may break backwards compatibility if
        their serialized pickled form changes.

        Returns:
            object: Any extra state to store in the module's state_dict
