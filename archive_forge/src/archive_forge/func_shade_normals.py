def shade_normals(self, normals, fraction=1.0):
    """
        Calculate the illumination intensity for the normal vectors of a
        surface using the defined azimuth and elevation for the light source.

        Imagine an artificial sun placed at infinity in some azimuth and
        elevation position illuminating our surface. The parts of the surface
        that slope toward the sun should brighten while those sides facing away
        should become darker.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fraction : number, optional
            Increases or decreases the contrast of the hillshade.  Values
            greater than one will cause intermediate values to move closer to
            full illumination or shadow (and clipping any values that move
            beyond 0 or 1). Note that this is not visually or mathematically
            the same as vertical exaggeration.

        Returns
        -------
        `~numpy.ndarray`
            A 2D array of illumination values between 0-1, where 0 is
            completely in shadow and 1 is completely illuminated.
