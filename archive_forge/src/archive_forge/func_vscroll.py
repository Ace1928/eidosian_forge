    The x and y parameters detail where the mouse event happens. If None, the
    current mouse position is used. If a float value, it is rounded down. If
    outside the boundaries of the screen, the event happens at edge of the
    screen.

    Args:
      clicks (int, float): The amount of scrolling to perform.
      x (int, float, None, tuple, optional): The x position on the screen where the
        click happens. None by default. If tuple, this is used for x and y.
      y (int, float, None, optional): The y position on the screen where the
        click happens. None by default.
