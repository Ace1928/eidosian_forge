Compute matches when text contains a dot.

        Assuming the text is of the form NAME.NAME....[NAME], and is
        evaluable in self.namespace, it will be evaluated and its attributes
        (as revealed by dir()) are used as possible completions.  (For class
        instances, class members are also considered.)

        WARNING: this can still invoke arbitrary C code, if an object
        with a __getattr__ hook is evaluated.
