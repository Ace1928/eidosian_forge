    Parameters
    ----------
    result : Result
        Any model result supporting ``get_prediction``.
    start : int, str, or datetime, optional
        Zero-indexed observation number at which to start forecasting,
        i.e., the first forecast is start. Can also be a date string to
        parse or a datetime type. Default is the the zeroth observation.
    end : int, str, or datetime, optional
        Zero-indexed observation number at which to end forecasting, i.e.,
        the last forecast is end. Can also be a date string to
        parse or a datetime type. However, if the dates index does not
        have a fixed frequency, end must be an integer index if you
        want out of sample prediction. Default is the last observation in
        the sample.
    dynamic : bool, int, str, or datetime, optional
        Integer offset relative to `start` at which to begin dynamic
        prediction. Can also be an absolute date string to parse or a
        datetime type (these are not interpreted as offsets).
        Prior to this observation, true endogenous values will be used for
        prediction; starting with this observation and continuing through
        the end of prediction, forecasted endogenous values will be used
        instead.
    alpha : {float, None}
        The tail probability not covered by the confidence interval. Must
        be in (0, 1). Confidence interval is constructed assuming normally
        distributed shocks. If None, figure will not show the confidence
        interval.
    ax : AxesSubplot
        matplotlib Axes instance to use
    **predict_kwargs
        Any additional keyword arguments to pass to ``result.get_prediction``.

    Returns
    -------
    Figure
        matplotlib Figure containing the prediction plot
