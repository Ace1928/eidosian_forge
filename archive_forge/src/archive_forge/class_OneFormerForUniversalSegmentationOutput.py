    Class for outputs of [`OneFormerForUniversalSegmentationOutput`].

    This output can be directly passed to [`~OneFormerImageProcessor.post_process_semantic_segmentation`] or
    [`~OneFormerImageProcessor.post_process_instance_segmentation`] or
    [`~OneFormerImageProcessor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation`] depending on the task. Please, see
    [`~OneFormerImageProcessor] for details regarding usage.

    Args:
