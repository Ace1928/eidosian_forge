    Performs non-maximum suppression in a batched fashion.

    Each index value correspond to a category, and NMS
    will not be applied between elements of different categories.

    Args:
        boxes (Tensor[N, 4]): boxes where NMS will be performed. They
            are expected to be in ``(x1, y1, x2, y2)`` format with ``0 <= x1 < x2`` and
            ``0 <= y1 < y2``.
        scores (Tensor[N]): scores for each one of the boxes
        idxs (Tensor[N]): indices of the categories for each one of the boxes.
        iou_threshold (float): discards all overlapping boxes with IoU > iou_threshold

    Returns:
        Tensor: int64 tensor with the indices of the elements that have been kept by NMS, sorted
        in decreasing order of scores
