    """EphemeralStorageLocalSsdConfig contains configuration for the node
  ephemeral storage using Local SSDs.

  Fields:
    localSsdCount: Number of local SSDs to use to back ephemeral storage. Uses
      NVMe interfaces. A zero (or unset) value has different meanings
      depending on machine type being used: 1. For pre-Gen3 machines, which
      support flexible numbers of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to disable
      using local SSDs as ephemeral storage. The limit for this value is
      dependent upon the maximum number of disk available on a machine per
      zone. See: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd for
      more information. 2. For Gen3 machines which dictate a specific number
      of local ssds, zero (or unset) means to use the default number of local
      ssds that goes with that machine type. For example, for a
      c3-standard-8-lssd machine, 2 local ssds would be provisioned. For
      c3-standard-8 (which doesn't support local ssds), 0 will be provisioned.
      See https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-
      ssd#choose_number_local_ssds for more info.
