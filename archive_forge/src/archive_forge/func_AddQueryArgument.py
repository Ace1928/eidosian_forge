def AddQueryArgument(parser):
    parser.add_argument('--query', metavar='QUERY', required=False, help="        Query statement. See [how to construct a\n        query](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query)\n        for more information. If not specified or empty, it will search all the\n        IAM policies within the specified ```scope```. Note that the query\n        string is compared against each Cloud IAM policy binding, including its\n        principals, roles, and Cloud IAM conditions. The returned Cloud IAM\n        policies will only contain the bindings that match your query. To learn\n        more about the IAM policy structure, see the [IAM policy documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/allow-policies/structure).\n\n        Examples:\n\n        * ```policy:amy@gmail.com``` to find IAM policy bindings that specify\n          user ``amy@gmail.com''.\n        * ```policy:roles/compute.admin``` to find IAM policy bindings that\n          specify the Compute Admin role.\n        * ```policy:comp*``` to find IAM policy bindings that contain ``comp''\n          as a prefix of any word in the binding.\n        * ```policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update``` to find IAM\n          policy bindings that specify a role containing the\n          ``storage.buckets.update'' permission. Note that if callers haven't\n          been granted the ``iam.roles.get'' permission for a role's included\n          permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will be dropped\n          from the search results.\n        * ```policy.role.permissions:upd*``` to find IAM policy bindings that\n          specify a role containing ``upd'' as a prefix of any word in the role\n          permission. Note that if callers haven't been granted the\n          ``iam.roles.get'' permission for a role's included permissions, policy\n          bindings that specify this role will be dropped from the search\n          results.\n        * ```resource:organizations/123456``` to find IAM policy bindings that\n          are set on ``organizations/123456''.\n        * ```resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject```\n          to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project named\n          ``myproject''.\n        * ```Important``` to find IAM policy bindings that contain ``Important''\n          as a word in any of the searchable fields (except for the included\n          permissions).\n        * ```resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy``` to find IAM policy\n          bindings that are set on resources ``instance1'' or ``instance2'' and\n          also specify user ``amy''.\n        * ```roles:roles/compute.admin``` to find IAM policy bindings that\n          specify the Compute Admin role.\n        * ```memberTypes:user``` to find IAM policy bindings that contain the\n          ``user'' principal type.\n        ")
