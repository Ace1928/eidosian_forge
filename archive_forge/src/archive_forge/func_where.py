    Returns a tensor of elements from either :code:`x` or :code:`y`, depending on :code:`condition`.

    Note that :code:`x` and :code:`y` are always evaluated regardless of the value of :code:`condition`.

    If you want to avoid unintended memory operations, use the :code:`mask` arguments in `triton.load` and `triton.store` instead.

    The shape of :code:`x` and :code:`y` are both broadcast to the shape of :code:`condition`.
    :code:`x` and :code:`y` must have the same data type.

    :param condition: When True (nonzero), yield x, otherwise yield y.
    :type condition: Block of triton.bool
    :param x: values selected at indices where condition is True.
    :param y: values selected at indices where condition is False.
