class ExtraTreesRegressor(ForestRegressor):
    """
    An extra-trees regressor.

    This class implements a meta estimator that fits a number of
    randomized decision trees (a.k.a. extra-trees) on various sub-samples
    of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy
    and control over-fitting.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <forest>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : int, default=100
        The number of trees in the forest.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.22
           The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
           in 0.22.

    criterion : {"squared_error", "absolute_error", "friedman_mse", "poisson"},             default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
        loss using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses
        mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
        splits, "absolute_error" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes
        the L1 loss using the median of each terminal node, and "poisson" which
        uses reduction in Poisson deviance to find splits.
        Training using "absolute_error" is significantly slower
        than when using "squared_error".

        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for fractions.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : {"sqrt", "log2", None}, int or float, default=1.0
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None or 1.0, then `max_features=n_features`.

        .. note::
            The default of 1.0 is equivalent to bagged trees and more
            randomness can be achieved by setting smaller values, e.g. 0.3.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.1
            The default of `max_features` changed from `"auto"` to 1.0.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

        .. versionadded:: 0.19

    bootstrap : bool, default=False
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
        whole dataset is used to build each tree.

    oob_score : bool or callable, default=False
        Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
        By default, :func:`~sklearn.metrics.r2_score` is used.
        Provide a callable with signature `metric(y_true, y_pred)` to use a
        custom metric. Only available if `bootstrap=True`.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
        :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
        trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
        context. ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary
        <n_jobs>` for more details.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls 3 sources of randomness:

        - the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees
          (if ``bootstrap=True``)
        - the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best
          split at each node (if ``max_features < n_features``)
        - the draw of the splits for each of the `max_features`

        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

    warm_start : bool, default=False
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`Glossary <warm_start>` and
        :ref:`gradient_boosting_warm_start` for details.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
        :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    max_samples : int or float, default=None
        If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
        to train each base estimator.

        - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
        - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
        - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
          `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0.0, 1.0]`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.22

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
        Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
          - 1: monotonically increasing
          - 0: no constraint
          - -1: monotonically decreasing

        If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

        Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
          - multioutput regressions (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
          - regressions trained on data with missing values.

        Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <monotonic_cst_gbdt>`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator_ : :class:`~sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeRegressor`
        The child estimator template used to create the collection of fitted
        sub-estimators.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2
           `base_estimator_` was renamed to `estimator_`.

    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeRegressor
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.

    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The impurity-based feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the (normalized)
        total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature.  It is also
        known as the Gini importance.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
        high cardinality features (many unique values). See
        :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs.

    oob_score_ : float
        Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate.
        This attribute exists only when ``oob_score`` is True.

    oob_prediction_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs)
        Prediction computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training set.
        This attribute exists only when ``oob_score`` is True.

    estimators_samples_ : list of arrays
        The subset of drawn samples (i.e., the in-bag samples) for each base
        estimator. Each subset is defined by an array of the indices selected.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.
