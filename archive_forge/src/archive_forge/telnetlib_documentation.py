Read until one from a list of a regular expressions matches.

        The first argument is a list of regular expressions, either
        compiled (re.Pattern instances) or uncompiled (strings).
        The optional second argument is a timeout, in seconds; default
        is no timeout.

        Return a tuple of three items: the index in the list of the
        first regular expression that matches; the re.Match object
        returned; and the text read up till and including the match.

        If EOF is read and no text was read, raise EOFError.
        Otherwise, when nothing matches, return (-1, None, text) where
        text is the text received so far (may be the empty string if a
        timeout happened).

        If a regular expression ends with a greedy match (e.g. '.*')
        or if more than one expression can match the same input, the
        results are undeterministic, and may depend on the I/O timing.
