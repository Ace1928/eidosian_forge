def edge_betweenness_centrality(G, k=None, normalized=True, weight=None, seed=None):
    """Compute betweenness centrality for edges.

    Betweenness centrality of an edge $e$ is the sum of the
    fraction of all-pairs shortest paths that pass through $e$

    .. math::

       c_B(e) =\\sum_{s,t \\in V} \\frac{\\sigma(s, t|e)}{\\sigma(s, t)}

    where $V$ is the set of nodes, $\\sigma(s, t)$ is the number of
    shortest $(s, t)$-paths, and $\\sigma(s, t|e)$ is the number of
    those paths passing through edge $e$ [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    k : int, optional (default=None)
      If k is not None use k node samples to estimate betweenness.
      The value of k <= n where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
      Higher values give better approximation.

    normalized : bool, optional
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by $2/(n(n-1))$
      for graphs, and $1/(n(n-1))$ for directed graphs where $n$
      is the number of nodes in G.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.
      Weights are used to calculate weighted shortest paths, so they are
      interpreted as distances.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
        Note that this is only used if k is not None.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : dictionary
       Dictionary of edges with betweenness centrality as the value.

    See Also
    --------
    betweenness_centrality
    edge_load

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm is from Ulrik Brandes [1]_.

    For weighted graphs the edge weights must be greater than zero.
    Zero edge weights can produce an infinite number of equal length
    paths between pairs of nodes.
