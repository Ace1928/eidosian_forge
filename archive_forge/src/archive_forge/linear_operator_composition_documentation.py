Initialize a `LinearOperatorComposition`.

    `LinearOperatorComposition` is initialized with a list of operators
    `[op_1,...,op_J]`.  For the `matmul` method to be well defined, the
    composition `op_i.matmul(op_{i+1}(x))` must be defined.  Other methods have
    similar constraints.

    Args:
      operators:  Iterable of `LinearOperator` objects, each with
        the same `dtype` and composable shape.
      is_non_singular:  Expect that this operator is non-singular.
      is_self_adjoint:  Expect that this operator is equal to its hermitian
        transpose.
      is_positive_definite:  Expect that this operator is positive definite,
        meaning the quadratic form `x^H A x` has positive real part for all
        nonzero `x`.  Note that we do not require the operator to be
        self-adjoint to be positive-definite.  See:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Extension_for_non-symmetric_matrices
      is_square:  Expect that this operator acts like square [batch] matrices.
      name: A name for this `LinearOperator`.  Default is the individual
        operators names joined with `_o_`.

    Raises:
      TypeError:  If all operators do not have the same `dtype`.
      ValueError:  If `operators` is empty.
