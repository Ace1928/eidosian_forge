    Check the validity of the provided solution.

    A valid (optimal) solution satisfies all bounds, all slack variables are
    negative and all equality constraint residuals are strictly non-zero.
    Further, the lower-bounds, upper-bounds, slack and residuals contain
    no nan values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1-D array
        Solution vector to original linear programming problem
    fun: float
        optimal objective value for original problem
    status : int
        An integer representing the exit status of the optimization::

             0 : Optimization terminated successfully
             1 : Iteration limit reached
             2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
             3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
             4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered

    slack : 1-D array
        The (non-negative) slack in the upper bound constraints, that is,
        ``b_ub - A_ub @ x``
    con : 1-D array
        The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality constraints, that is,
        ``b - A_eq @ x``
    bounds : 2D array
        The bounds on the original variables ``x``
    message : str
        A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
    tol : float
        Termination tolerance; see [1]_ Section 4.5.

    Returns
    -------
    status : int
        An integer representing the exit status of the optimization::

             0 : Optimization terminated successfully
             1 : Iteration limit reached
             2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
             3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
             4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered

    message : str
        A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
