def set_prop_cycle(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """
        Set the property cycle of the Axes.

        The property cycle controls the style properties such as color,
        marker and linestyle of future plot commands. The style properties
        of data already added to the Axes are not modified.

        Call signatures::

          set_prop_cycle(cycler)
          set_prop_cycle(label=values[, label2=values2[, ...]])
          set_prop_cycle(label, values)

        Form 1 sets given `~cycler.Cycler` object.

        Form 2 creates a `~cycler.Cycler` which cycles over one or more
        properties simultaneously and set it as the property cycle of the
        Axes. If multiple properties are given, their value lists must have
        the same length. This is just a shortcut for explicitly creating a
        cycler and passing it to the function, i.e. it's short for
        ``set_prop_cycle(cycler(label=values label2=values2, ...))``.

        Form 3 creates a `~cycler.Cycler` for a single property and set it
        as the property cycle of the Axes. This form exists for compatibility
        with the original `cycler.cycler` interface. Its use is discouraged
        in favor of the kwarg form, i.e. ``set_prop_cycle(label=values)``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cycler : `~cycler.Cycler`
            Set the given Cycler. *None* resets to the cycle defined by the
            current style.

            .. ACCEPTS: `~cycler.Cycler`

        label : str
            The property key. Must be a valid `.Artist` property.
            For example, 'color' or 'linestyle'. Aliases are allowed,
            such as 'c' for 'color' and 'lw' for 'linewidth'.

        values : iterable
            Finite-length iterable of the property values. These values
            are validated and will raise a ValueError if invalid.

        See Also
        --------
        matplotlib.rcsetup.cycler
            Convenience function for creating validated cyclers for properties.
        cycler.cycler
            The original function for creating unvalidated cyclers.

        Examples
        --------
        Setting the property cycle for a single property:

        >>> ax.set_prop_cycle(color=['red', 'green', 'blue'])

        Setting the property cycle for simultaneously cycling over multiple
        properties (e.g. red circle, green plus, blue cross):

        >>> ax.set_prop_cycle(color=['red', 'green', 'blue'],
        ...                   marker=['o', '+', 'x'])
