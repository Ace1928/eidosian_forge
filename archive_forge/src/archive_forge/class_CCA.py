class CCA(_PLS):
    """Canonical Correlation Analysis, also known as "Mode B" PLS.

    For a comparison between other cross decomposition algorithms, see
    :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cross_decomposition_plot_compare_cross_decomposition.py`.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_decomposition>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, default=2
        Number of components to keep. Should be in `[1, min(n_samples,
        n_features, n_targets)]`.

    scale : bool, default=True
        Whether to scale `X` and `Y`.

    max_iter : int, default=500
        The maximum number of iterations of the power method.

    tol : float, default=1e-06
        The tolerance used as convergence criteria in the power method: the
        algorithm stops whenever the squared norm of `u_i - u_{i-1}` is less
        than `tol`, where `u` corresponds to the left singular vector.

    copy : bool, default=True
        Whether to copy `X` and `Y` in fit before applying centering, and
        potentially scaling. If False, these operations will be done inplace,
        modifying both arrays.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x_weights_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_components)
        The left singular vectors of the cross-covariance matrices of each
        iteration.

    y_weights_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets, n_components)
        The right singular vectors of the cross-covariance matrices of each
        iteration.

    x_loadings_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_components)
        The loadings of `X`.

    y_loadings_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets, n_components)
        The loadings of `Y`.

    x_rotations_ : ndarray of shape (n_features, n_components)
        The projection matrix used to transform `X`.

    y_rotations_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets, n_components)
        The projection matrix used to transform `Y`.

    coef_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets, n_features)
        The coefficients of the linear model such that `Y` is approximated as
        `Y = X @ coef_.T + intercept_`.

    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (n_targets,)
        The intercepts of the linear model such that `Y` is approximated as
        `Y = X @ coef_.T + intercept_`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    n_iter_ : list of shape (n_components,)
        Number of iterations of the power method, for each
        component.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
