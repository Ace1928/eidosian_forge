It is helpful when using the matplotlib Exporter if your
.matplotlib/matplotlibrc file is configured appropriately.
The following are suggested for getting usable PDF output that
can be edited in Illustrator, etc.

backend      : Qt4Agg
text.usetex : True  # Assumes you have a findable LaTeX installation
interactive : False
font.family : sans-serif
font.sans-serif : 'Arial'  # (make first in list)
mathtext.default : sf
figure.facecolor : white  # personal preference
# next setting allows pdf font to be readable in Adobe Illustrator
pdf.fonttype : 42   # set fonts to TrueType (otherwise it will be 3
                    # and the text will be vectorized.
text.dvipnghack : True  # primarily to clean up font appearance on Mac

The advantage is that there is less to do to get an exported file cleaned and ready for
publication. Fonts are not vectorized (outlined), and window colors are white.
