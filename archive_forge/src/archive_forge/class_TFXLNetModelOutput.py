    """
    Output type of [`TFXLNetModel`].

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_predict, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the last layer of the model.

            `num_predict` corresponds to `target_mapping.shape[1]`. If `target_mapping` is `None`, then `num_predict`
            corresponds to `sequence_length`.
        mems (`List[tf.Tensor]` of length `config.n_layers`):
            Contains pre-computed hidden-states. Can be used (see `mems` input) to speed up sequential decoding. The
            token ids which have their past given to this model should not be passed as `input_ids` as they have
            already been computed.
        hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
