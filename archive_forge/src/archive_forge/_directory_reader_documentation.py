    Class to allow PackageImporter to operate on unzipped packages. Methods
    copy the behavior of the internal PyTorchFileReader class (which is used for
    accessing packages in all other cases).

    N.B.: ScriptObjects are not depickleable or accessible via this DirectoryReader
    class due to ScriptObjects requiring an actual PyTorchFileReader instance.
