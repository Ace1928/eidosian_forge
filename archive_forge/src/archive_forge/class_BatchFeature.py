    Holds the output of the image processor specific `__call__` methods.

    This class is derived from a python dictionary and can be used as a dictionary.

    Args:
        data (`dict`):
            Dictionary of lists/arrays/tensors returned by the __call__ method ('pixel_values', etc.).
        tensor_type (`Union[None, str, TensorType]`, *optional*):
            You can give a tensor_type here to convert the lists of integers in PyTorch/TensorFlow/Numpy Tensors at
            initialization.
