        Convert a graph data structure into a path structure for plotting

        Given a set of nodes (as a dataframe with a unique ID for each
        node) and a set of edges (as a dataframe with with columns for the
        source and destination IDs for each edge), returns a dataframe
        with with one path for each edge suitable for use with
        Datashader. The returned dataframe has columns for x and y
        location, with paths represented as successive points separated by
        a point with NaN as the x or y value.
