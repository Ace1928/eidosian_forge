            When the context is lost no more GL methods can be called until it
            is recreated.  This is a rare event, triggered perhaps by the user
            switching to an incompatible video mode.  When it occurs, an
            application will need to reload all objects (display lists, texture
            objects, shaders) as well as restore the GL state.
