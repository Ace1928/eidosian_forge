    """An implementation of a single RPC method.

    Attributes:
      request_streaming: Whether the RPC supports exactly one request message
        or any arbitrary number of request messages.
      response_streaming: Whether the RPC supports exactly one response message
        or any arbitrary number of response messages.
      request_deserializer: A callable :term:`deserializer` that accepts a byte string and
        returns an object suitable to be passed to this object's business
        logic, or None to indicate that this object's business logic should be
        passed the raw request bytes.
      response_serializer: A callable :term:`serializer` that accepts an object produced
        by this object's business logic and returns a byte string, or None to
        indicate that the byte strings produced by this object's business logic
        should be transmitted on the wire as they are.
      unary_unary: This object's application-specific business logic as a
        callable value that takes a request value and a ServicerContext object
        and returns a response value. Only non-None if both request_streaming
        and response_streaming are False.
      unary_stream: This object's application-specific business logic as a
        callable value that takes a request value and a ServicerContext object
        and returns an iterator of response values. Only non-None if
        request_streaming is False and response_streaming is True.
      stream_unary: This object's application-specific business logic as a
        callable value that takes an iterator of request values and a
        ServicerContext object and returns a response value. Only non-None if
        request_streaming is True and response_streaming is False.
      stream_stream: This object's application-specific business logic as a
        callable value that takes an iterator of request values and a
        ServicerContext object and returns an iterator of response values.
        Only non-None if request_streaming and response_streaming are both
        True.
