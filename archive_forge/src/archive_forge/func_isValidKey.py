    PyAutoGUI's keyboard-related functions for the current platform.

    This function is here because passing an invalid value to the PyAutoGUI
    keyboard functions currently is a no-op that does not raise an exception.

    Some keys are only valid on some platforms. For example, while 'esc' is
    valid for the Escape key on all platforms, 'browserback' is only used on
    Windows operating systems.

      key (str): The key value.

    Returns:
      bool: True if key is a valid value, False if not.
