def opening(image, footprint=None, out=None, *, mode='reflect', cval=0.0):
    """Return grayscale morphological opening of an image.

    The morphological opening of an image is defined as an erosion followed by
    a dilation. Opening can remove small bright spots (i.e. "salt") and connect
    small dark cracks. This tends to "open" up (dark) gaps between (bright)
    features.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Image array.
    footprint : ndarray or tuple, optional
        The neighborhood expressed as a 2-D array of 1's and 0's.
        If None, use a cross-shaped footprint (connectivity=1). The footprint
        can also be provided as a sequence of smaller footprints as described
        in the notes below.
    out : ndarray, optional
        The array to store the result of the morphology. If None
        is passed, a new array will be allocated.
    mode : str, optional
        The `mode` parameter determines how the array borders are handled.
        Valid modes are: 'reflect', 'constant', 'nearest', 'mirror', 'wrap',
        'max', 'min', or 'ignore'.
        If 'ignore', pixels outside the image domain are assumed
        to be the maximum for the image's dtype in the erosion, and minimum
        in the dilation, which causes them to not influence the result.
        Default is 'reflect'.
    cval : scalar, optional
        Value to fill past edges of input if `mode` is 'constant'. Default
        is 0.0.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23
            `mode` and `cval` were added in 0.23.

    Returns
    -------
    opening : array, same shape and type as `image`
        The result of the morphological opening.

    Notes
    -----
    The footprint can also be a provided as a sequence of 2-tuples where the
    first element of each 2-tuple is a footprint ndarray and the second element
    is an integer describing the number of times it should be iterated. For
    example ``footprint=[(np.ones((9, 1)), 1), (np.ones((1, 9)), 1)]``
    would apply a 9x1 footprint followed by a 1x9 footprint resulting in a net
    effect that is the same as ``footprint=np.ones((9, 9))``, but with lower
    computational cost. Most of the builtin footprints such as
    :func:`skimage.morphology.disk` provide an option to automatically generate
    a footprint sequence of this type.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Open up gap between two bright regions (but also shrink regions)
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from skimage.morphology import square
    >>> bad_connection = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    ...                            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    ...                            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    ...                            [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    ...                            [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> opening(bad_connection, square(3))
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)
