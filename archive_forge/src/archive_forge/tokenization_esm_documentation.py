        Retrieves sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added. This method is called when adding
        special tokens using the tokenizer `prepare_for_model` or `encode_plus` methods.

        Args:
            token_ids_0 (`List[int]`):
                List of ids of the first sequence.
            token_ids_1 (`List[int]`, *optional*):
                List of ids of the second sequence.
            already_has_special_tokens (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not the token list is already formatted with special tokens for the model.

        Returns:
            A list of integers in the range [0, 1]: 1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.
