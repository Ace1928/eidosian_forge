class TFBaseModelOutputWithPooling(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs that also contains a pooling of the last hidden states.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        pooler_output (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`):
            Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) further processed by a
            Linear layer and a Tanh activation function. The Linear layer weights are trained from the next sentence
            prediction (classification) objective during pretraining.

            This output is usually *not* a good summary of the semantic content of the input, you're often better with
            averaging or pooling the sequence of hidden-states for the whole input sequence.
        hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
