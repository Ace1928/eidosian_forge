def subgraph_centrality(G):
    """Returns subgraph centrality for each node in G.

    Subgraph centrality  of a node `n` is the sum of weighted closed
    walks of all lengths starting and ending at node `n`. The weights
    decrease with path length. Each closed walk is associated with a
    connected subgraph ([1]_).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: graph

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with subgraph centrality as the value.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       If the graph is not undirected and simple.

    See Also
    --------
    subgraph_centrality_exp:
        Alternative algorithm of the subgraph centrality for each node of G.

    Notes
    -----
    This version of the algorithm computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    of the adjacency matrix.

    Subgraph centrality of a node `u` in G can be found using
    a spectral decomposition of the adjacency matrix [1]_,

    .. math::

       SC(u)=\\sum_{j=1}^{N}(v_{j}^{u})^2 e^{\\lambda_{j}},

    where `v_j` is an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix `A` of G
    corresponding to the eigenvalue `\\lambda_j`.

    Examples
    --------
    (Example from [1]_)
    >>> G = nx.Graph(
    ...     [
    ...         (1, 2),
    ...         (1, 5),
    ...         (1, 8),
    ...         (2, 3),
    ...         (2, 8),
    ...         (3, 4),
    ...         (3, 6),
    ...         (4, 5),
    ...         (4, 7),
    ...         (5, 6),
    ...         (6, 7),
    ...         (7, 8),
    ...     ]
    ... )
    >>> sc = nx.subgraph_centrality(G)
    >>> print([f"{node} {sc[node]:0.2f}" for node in sorted(sc)])
