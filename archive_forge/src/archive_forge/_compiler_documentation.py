    Generate an overlap table for the following prefix.
    An overlap table is a table of the same size as the prefix which
    informs about the potential self-overlap for each index in the prefix:
    - if overlap[i] == 0, prefix[i:] can't overlap prefix[0:...]
    - if overlap[i] == k with 0 < k <= i, prefix[i-k+1:i+1] overlaps with
      prefix[0:k]
