    Return the overlapping region between saved_shard and current_shard.

    There returned list has the same number of elements as the tensor's dimension.
    For each element, we produce a tuple with the following contents:
        (dimension, `saved_shard` offset, `current_shard` offset, length)

    Offsets are relative to each shard.
