    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int or ndarray
        The number of clusters to form.

    children : ndarray of shape (n_nodes-1, 2)
        The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than `n_samples`
        correspond to leaves of the tree which are the original samples.
        A node `i` greater than or equal to `n_samples` is a non-leaf
        node and has children `children_[i - n_samples]`. Alternatively
        at the i-th iteration, children[i][0] and children[i][1]
        are merged to form node `n_samples + i`.

    n_leaves : int
        Number of leaves of the tree.

    Returns
    -------
    labels : array [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point.
