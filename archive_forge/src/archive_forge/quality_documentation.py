Returns the coverage and performance of a partition of G.

    The *coverage* of a partition is the ratio of the number of
    intra-community edges to the total number of edges in the graph.

    The *performance* of a partition is the number of
    intra-community edges plus inter-community non-edges divided by the total
    number of potential edges.

    This algorithm has complexity $O(C^2 + L)$ where C is the number of communities and L is the number of links.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    partition : sequence
        Partition of the nodes of `G`, represented as a sequence of
        sets of nodes (blocks). Each block of the partition represents a
        community.

    Returns
    -------
    (float, float)
        The (coverage, performance) tuple of the partition, as defined above.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `partition` is not a valid partition of the nodes of `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    If `G` is a multigraph;
        - for coverage, the multiplicity of edges is counted
        - for performance, the result is -1 (total number of possible edges is not defined)
