    """
    A non-terminal symbol for a context free grammar.  ``Nonterminal``
    is a wrapper class for node values; it is used by ``Production``
    objects to distinguish node values from leaf values.
    The node value that is wrapped by a ``Nonterminal`` is known as its
    "symbol".  Symbols are typically strings representing phrasal
    categories (such as ``"NP"`` or ``"VP"``).  However, more complex
    symbol types are sometimes used (e.g., for lexicalized grammars).
    Since symbols are node values, they must be immutable and
    hashable.  Two ``Nonterminals`` are considered equal if their
    symbols are equal.
