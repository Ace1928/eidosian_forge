    circumstances.

    For example, you might get this if you try to send data on a stream where
    the remote side has already closed the connection.

    You *don't* get this error if *you* closed the resource – in that case you
    get :class:`ClosedResourceError`.

    This exception's ``__cause__`` attribute will often contain more
    information about the underlying error.
