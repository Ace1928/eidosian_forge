    """Cache of reply queue id that doesn't exist anymore.

    NOTE(sileht): In case of a broker restart/failover
    a reply queue can be unreachable for short period
    the IncomingMessage.send_reply will block for 60 seconds
    in this case or until rabbit recovers.

    But in case of the reply queue is unreachable because the
    rpc client is really gone, we can have a ton of reply to send
    waiting 60 seconds.
    This leads to a starvation of connection of the pool
    The rpc server take to much time to send reply, other rpc client will
    raise TimeoutError because their don't receive their replies in time.

    This object cache stores already known gone client to not wait 60 seconds
    and hold a connection of the pool.
    Keeping 200 last gone rpc client for 1 minute is enough
    and doesn't hold to much memory.
