    """Randomly masks out entire channels.

    A channel is a feature map,
    e.g. the :math:`j`-th channel of the :math:`i`-th sample in the batch input
    is a tensor :math:`\\text{input}[i, j]` of the input tensor). Instead of
    setting activations to zero, as in regular Dropout, the activations are set
    to the negative saturation value of the SELU activation function. More details
    can be found in the paper `Self-Normalizing Neural Networks`_ .

    Each element will be masked independently for each sample on every forward
    call with probability :attr:`p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.
    The elements to be masked are randomized on every forward call, and scaled
    and shifted to maintain zero mean and unit variance.

    Usually the input comes from :class:`nn.AlphaDropout` modules.

    As described in the paper
    `Efficient Object Localization Using Convolutional Networks`_ ,
    if adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated
    (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then i.i.d. dropout
    will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result
    in an effective learning rate decrease.

    In this case, :func:`nn.AlphaDropout` will help promote independence between
    feature maps and should be used instead.

    Args:
        p (float, optional): probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
        inplace (bool, optional): If set to ``True``, will do this operation
            in-place

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C, D, H, W)` or :math:`(C, D, H, W)`.
        - Output: :math:`(N, C, D, H, W)` or :math:`(C, D, H, W)` (same shape as input).

    Examples::

        >>> m = nn.FeatureAlphaDropout(p=0.2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 4, 32, 32)
        >>> output = m(input)
