        Check if the dynamic linker is MSVC. Used by Executable, StaticLibrary,
        and SharedLibrary for deciding when to use MSVC-specific file naming
        and debug filenames.

        If at least some code is built with MSVC and the final library is
        linked with MSVC, we can be sure that some debug info will be
        generated. We only check the dynamic linker here because the static
        linker is guaranteed to be of the same type.

        Interesting cases:
        1. The Vala compiler outputs C code to be compiled by whatever
           C compiler we're using, so all objects will still be created by the
           MSVC compiler.
        2. If the target contains only objects, process_compilers guesses and
           picks the first compiler that smells right.
