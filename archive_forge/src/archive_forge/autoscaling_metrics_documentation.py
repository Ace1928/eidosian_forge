Perform a max operation for metric `key`.

        Args:
            key: the metric name.
            window_start_timestamp_s: the unix epoch timestamp for the
              start of the window. The computed average will use all datapoints
              from this timestamp until now.
            do_compact: whether or not to delete the datapoints that's
              before `window_start_timestamp_s` to save memory. Default is
              true.
        Returns:
            Max value of the data points for the key on and after time
            window_start_timestamp_s, or None if there are no such points.
