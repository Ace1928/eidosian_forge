        """Run a statement through the python code profiler.

        Usage, in line mode:
          %prun [options] statement

        Usage, in cell mode:
          %%prun [options] [statement]
          code...
          code...

        In cell mode, the additional code lines are appended to the (possibly
        empty) statement in the first line.  Cell mode allows you to easily
        profile multiline blocks without having to put them in a separate
        function.

        The given statement (which doesn't require quote marks) is run via the
        python profiler in a manner similar to the profile.run() function.
        Namespaces are internally managed to work correctly; profile.run
        cannot be used in IPython because it makes certain assumptions about
        namespaces which do not hold under IPython.

        Options:

        -l <limit>
          you can place restrictions on what or how much of the
          profile gets printed. The limit value can be:

             * A string: only information for function names containing this string
               is printed.

             * An integer: only these many lines are printed.

             * A float (between 0 and 1): this fraction of the report is printed
               (for example, use a limit of 0.4 to see the topmost 40% only).

          You can combine several limits with repeated use of the option. For
          example, ``-l __init__ -l 5`` will print only the topmost 5 lines of
          information about class constructors.

        -r
          return the pstats.Stats object generated by the profiling. This
          object has all the information about the profile in it, and you can
          later use it for further analysis or in other functions.

        -s <key>
          sort profile by given key. You can provide more than one key
          by using the option several times: '-s key1 -s key2 -s key3...'. The
          default sorting key is 'time'.

          The following is copied verbatim from the profile documentation
          referenced below:

          When more than one key is provided, additional keys are used as
          secondary criteria when the there is equality in all keys selected
          before them.

          Abbreviations can be used for any key names, as long as the
          abbreviation is unambiguous.  The following are the keys currently
          defined:

          ============  =====================
          Valid Arg     Meaning
          ============  =====================
          "calls"       call count
          "cumulative"  cumulative time
          "file"        file name
          "module"      file name
          "pcalls"      primitive call count
          "line"        line number
          "name"        function name
          "nfl"         name/file/line
          "stdname"     standard name
          "time"        internal time
          ============  =====================

          Note that all sorts on statistics are in descending order (placing
          most time consuming items first), where as name, file, and line number
          searches are in ascending order (i.e., alphabetical). The subtle
          distinction between "nfl" and "stdname" is that the standard name is a
          sort of the name as printed, which means that the embedded line
          numbers get compared in an odd way.  For example, lines 3, 20, and 40
          would (if the file names were the same) appear in the string order
          "20" "3" and "40".  In contrast, "nfl" does a numeric compare of the
          line numbers.  In fact, sort_stats("nfl") is the same as
          sort_stats("name", "file", "line").

        -T <filename>
          save profile results as shown on screen to a text
          file. The profile is still shown on screen.

        -D <filename>
          save (via dump_stats) profile statistics to given
          filename. This data is in a format understood by the pstats module, and
          is generated by a call to the dump_stats() method of profile
          objects. The profile is still shown on screen.

        -q
          suppress output to the pager.  Best used with -T and/or -D above.

        If you want to run complete programs under the profiler's control, use
        ``%run -p [prof_opts] filename.py [args to program]`` where prof_opts
        contains profiler specific options as described here.

        """Run the named file inside IPython as a program.

        Usage::

          %run [-n -i -e -G]
               [( -t [-N<N>] | -d [-b<N>] | -p [profile options] )]
               ( -m mod | filename ) [args]

        The filename argument should be either a pure Python script (with
        extension ``.py``), or a file with custom IPython syntax (such as
        magics). If the latter, the file can be either a script with ``.ipy``
        extension, or a Jupyter notebook with ``.ipynb`` extension. When running
        a Jupyter notebook, the output from print statements and other
        displayed objects will appear in the terminal (even matplotlib figures
        will open, if a terminal-compliant backend is being used). Note that,
        at the system command line, the ``jupyter run`` command offers similar
        functionality for executing notebooks (albeit currently with some
        differences in supported options).

        Parameters after the filename are passed as command-line arguments to
        the program (put in sys.argv). Then, control returns to IPython's
        prompt.

        This is similar to running at a system prompt ``python file args``,
        but with the advantage of giving you IPython's tracebacks, and of
        loading all variables into your interactive namespace for further use
        (unless -p is used, see below).

        The file is executed in a namespace initially consisting only of
        ``__name__=='__main__'`` and sys.argv constructed as indicated. It thus
        sees its environment as if it were being run as a stand-alone program
        (except for sharing global objects such as previously imported
        modules). But after execution, the IPython interactive namespace gets
        updated with all variables defined in the program (except for __name__
        and sys.argv). This allows for very convenient loading of code for
        interactive work, while giving each program a 'clean sheet' to run in.

        Arguments are expanded using shell-like glob match.  Patterns
        '*', '?', '[seq]' and '[!seq]' can be used.  Additionally,
        tilde '~' will be expanded into user's home directory.  Unlike
        real shells, quotation does not suppress expansions.  Use
        *two* back slashes (e.g. ``\\\\*``) to suppress expansions.
        To completely disable these expansions, you can use -G flag.

        On Windows systems, the use of single quotes `'` when specifying
        a file is not supported. Use double quotes `"`.

        Options:

        -n
          __name__ is NOT set to '__main__', but to the running file's name
          without extension (as python does under import).  This allows running
          scripts and reloading the definitions in them without calling code
          protected by an ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` clause.

        -i
          run the file in IPython's namespace instead of an empty one. This
          is useful if you are experimenting with code written in a text editor
          which depends on variables defined interactively.

        -e
          ignore sys.exit() calls or SystemExit exceptions in the script
          being run.  This is particularly useful if IPython is being used to
          run unittests, which always exit with a sys.exit() call.  In such
          cases you are interested in the output of the test results, not in
          seeing a traceback of the unittest module.

        -t
          print timing information at the end of the run.  IPython will give
          you an estimated CPU time consumption for your script, which under
          Unix uses the resource module to avoid the wraparound problems of
          time.clock().  Under Unix, an estimate of time spent on system tasks
          is also given (for Windows platforms this is reported as 0.0).

        If -t is given, an additional ``-N<N>`` option can be given, where <N>
        must be an integer indicating how many times you want the script to
        run.  The final timing report will include total and per run results.

        For example (testing the script uniq_stable.py)::

            In [1]: run -t uniq_stable

            IPython CPU timings (estimated):
              User  :    0.19597 s.
              System:        0.0 s.

            In [2]: run -t -N5 uniq_stable

            IPython CPU timings (estimated):
            Total runs performed: 5
              Times :      Total       Per run
              User  :   0.910862 s,  0.1821724 s.
              System:        0.0 s,        0.0 s.

        -d
          run your program under the control of pdb, the Python debugger.
          This allows you to execute your program step by step, watch variables,
          etc.  Internally, what IPython does is similar to calling::

              pdb.run('execfile("YOURFILENAME")')

          with a breakpoint set on line 1 of your file.  You can change the line
          number for this automatic breakpoint to be <N> by using the -bN option
          (where N must be an integer). For example::

              %run -d -b40 myscript

          will set the first breakpoint at line 40 in myscript.py.  Note that
          the first breakpoint must be set on a line which actually does
          something (not a comment or docstring) for it to stop execution.

          Or you can specify a breakpoint in a different file::

              %run -d -b myotherfile.py:20 myscript

          When the pdb debugger starts, you will see a (Pdb) prompt.  You must
          first enter 'c' (without quotes) to start execution up to the first
          breakpoint.

          Entering 'help' gives information about the use of the debugger.  You
          can easily see pdb's full documentation with "import pdb;pdb.help()"
          at a prompt.

        -p
          run program under the control of the Python profiler module (which
          prints a detailed report of execution times, function calls, etc).

          You can pass other options after -p which affect the behavior of the
          profiler itself. See the docs for %prun for details.

          In this mode, the program's variables do NOT propagate back to the
          IPython interactive namespace (because they remain in the namespace
          where the profiler executes them).

          Internally this triggers a call to %prun, see its documentation for
          details on the options available specifically for profiling.

        There is one special usage for which the text above doesn't apply:
        if the filename ends with .ipy[nb], the file is run as ipython script,
        just as if the commands were written on IPython prompt.

        -m
          specify module name to load instead of script path. Similar to

        Usage, in line mode:

        or in cell mode:

          code
          code...

        Time execution of a Python statement or expression using the timeit
        module.  This function can be used both as a line and cell magic:

        - In line mode you can time a single-line statement (though multiple
          ones can be chained with using semicolons).

        - In cell mode, the statement in the first line is used as setup code
          (executed but not timed) and the body of the cell is timed.  The cell
          body has access to any variables created in the setup code.

        Options:
        -n<N>: execute the given statement <N> times in a loop. If <N> is not
        provided, <N> is determined so as to get sufficient accuracy.

        -r<R>: number of repeats <R>, each consisting of <N> loops, and take the
        average result.
        Default: 7

        -t: use time.time to measure the time, which is the default on Unix.
        This function measures wall time.

        -c: use time.clock to measure the time, which is the default on
        Windows and measures wall time. On Unix, resource.getrusage is used
        instead and returns the CPU user time.

        -p<P>: use a precision of <P> digits to display the timing result.
        Default: 3

        -q: Quiet, do not print result.

        -o: return a TimeitResult that can be stored in a variable to inspect
            the result in more details.

        --------
        ::

          8.26 ns ± 0.12 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000000 loops each)

        The times reported by %timeit will be slightly higher than those
        reported by the timeit.py script when variables are accessed. This is
        due to the fact that %timeit executes the statement in the namespace
        of the shell, compared with timeit.py, which uses a single setup
        statement to import function or create variables. Generally, the bias
        does not matter as long as results from timeit.py are not mixed with
        those from %timeit."""

        The CPU and wall clock times are printed, and the value of the
        expression (if any) is returned.  Note that under Win32, system time
        is always reported as 0, since it can not be measured.

        This function can be used both as a line and cell magic:

        - In line mode you can time a single-line statement (though multiple
          ones can be chained with using semicolons).

        - In cell mode, you can time the cell body (a directly
          following statement raises an error).

        This function provides very basic timing functionality.  Use the timeit
        magic for more control over the measurement.

        filenames or string objects.

        Usage:\\
          %macro [options] name n1-n2 n3-n4 ... n5 .. n6 ...

        Options:

          -r: use 'raw' input.  By default, the 'processed' history is used,
          so that magics are loaded in their transformed version to valid
          Python.  If this option is given, the raw input as typed at the
          command line is used instead.
          
          -q: quiet macro definition.  By default, a tag line is printed 
          to indicate the macro has been created, and then the contents of 
          the macro are printed.  If this option is given, then no printout
          is produced once the macro is created.

        This will define a global variable called `name` which is a string
        made of joining the slices and lines you specify (n1,n2,... numbers
        above) from your input history into a single string. This variable
        acts like an automatic function which re-executes those lines as if
        you had typed them. You just type 'name' at the prompt and the code
        executes.

        The syntax for indicating input ranges is described in %history.

        Note: as a 'hidden' feature, you can also use traditional python slice
        notation, where N:M means numbers N through M-1.

        For example, if your history contains (print using %hist -n )::

          44: x=1
          45: y=3
          46: z=x+y
          47: print x
          48: a=5
          49: print 'x',x,'y',y

        you can create a macro with lines 44 through 47 (included) and line 49
        called my_macro with::

          In [55]: %macro my_macro 44-47 49

        Now, typing `my_macro` (without quotes) will re-execute all this code
        in one pass.

        You don't need to give the line-numbers in order, and any given line
        number can appear multiple times. You can assemble macros with any
        lines from your input history in any order.

        The macro is a simple object which holds its value in an attribute,
        but IPython's display system checks for macros and executes them as
        code instead of printing them when you type their name.

        You can view a macro's contents by explicitly printing it with::

          print macro_name
