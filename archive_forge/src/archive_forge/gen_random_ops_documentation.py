Outputs random values from a truncated normal distribution.

  The generated values follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard
  deviation 1, except that values whose magnitude is more than 2 standard
  deviations from the mean are dropped and re-picked.

  Args:
    shape: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.
      The shape of the output tensor.
    dtype: A `tf.DType` from: `tf.half, tf.bfloat16, tf.float32, tf.float64`.
      The type of the output.
    seed: An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`.
      If either `seed` or `seed2` are set to be non-zero, the random number
      generator is seeded by the given seed.  Otherwise, it is seeded by a
      random seed.
    seed2: An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`.
      A second seed to avoid seed collision.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of type `dtype`.
