def _find_reasonable_pivot_naive(col, iszerofunc=_iszero, simpfunc=None):
    """
    Helper that computes the pivot value and location from a
    sequence of contiguous matrix column elements. As a side effect
    of the pivot search, this function may simplify some of the elements
    of the input column. A list of these simplified entries and their
    indices are also returned.
    This function mimics the behavior of _find_reasonable_pivot(),
    but does less work trying to determine if an indeterminate candidate
    pivot simplifies to zero. This more naive approach can be much faster,
    with the trade-off that it may erroneously return a pivot that is zero.

    ``col`` is a sequence of contiguous column entries to be searched for
    a suitable pivot.
    ``iszerofunc`` is a callable that returns a Boolean that indicates
    if its input is zero, or None if no such determination can be made.
    ``simpfunc`` is a callable that simplifies its input. It must return
    its input if it does not simplify its input. Passing in
    ``simpfunc=None`` indicates that the pivot search should not attempt
    to simplify any candidate pivots.

    Returns a 4-tuple:
    (pivot_offset, pivot_val, assumed_nonzero, newly_determined)
    ``pivot_offset`` is the sequence index of the pivot.
    ``pivot_val`` is the value of the pivot.
    pivot_val and col[pivot_index] are equivalent, but will be different
    when col[pivot_index] was simplified during the pivot search.
    ``assumed_nonzero`` is a boolean indicating if the pivot cannot be
    guaranteed to be zero. If assumed_nonzero is true, then the pivot
    may or may not be non-zero. If assumed_nonzero is false, then
    the pivot is non-zero.
    ``newly_determined`` is a list of index-value pairs of pivot candidates
    that were simplified during the pivot search.
