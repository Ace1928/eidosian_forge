        In Mask2Former paper, uncertainty is estimated as L1 distance between 0.0 and the logit prediction in 'logits'
        for the foreground class in `classes`.

        Args:
            logits (`torch.Tensor`):
            A tensor of shape (R, 1, ...) for class-specific or class-agnostic, where R is the total number of predicted masks in all images and C is:
            the number of foreground classes. The values are logits.

        Returns:
            scores (`torch.Tensor`): A tensor of shape (R, 1, ...) that contains uncertainty scores with the most
            uncertain locations having the highest uncertainty score.
