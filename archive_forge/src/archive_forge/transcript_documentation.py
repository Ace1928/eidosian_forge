Find the next slash in {s} after {start} that is not preceded by a backslash.

        If we find an escaped slash, add everything up to and including it to regex,
        updating {start}. {start} therefore serves two purposes, tells us where to start
        looking for the next thing, and also tells us where in {s} we have already
        added things to {regex}

        {in_regex} specifies whether we are currently searching in a regex, we behave
        differently if we are or if we aren't.
