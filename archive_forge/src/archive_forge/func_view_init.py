        Set the elevation and azimuth of the axes in degrees (not radians).

        This can be used to rotate the axes programmatically.

        To look normal to the primary planes, the following elevation and
        azimuth angles can be used. A roll angle of 0, 90, 180, or 270 deg
        will rotate these views while keeping the axes at right angles.

        Parameters
        ----------
        elev : float, default: None
            The elevation angle in degrees rotates the camera above the plane
            pierced by the vertical axis, with a positive angle corresponding
            to a location above that plane. For example, with the default
            vertical axis of 'z', the elevation defines the angle of the camera
            location above the x-y plane.
            If None, then the initial value as specified in the `Axes3D`
            constructor is used.
        azim : float, default: None
            The azimuthal angle in degrees rotates the camera about the
            vertical axis, with a positive angle corresponding to a
            right-handed rotation. For example, with the default vertical axis
            of 'z', a positive azimuth rotates the camera about the origin from
            its location along the +x axis towards the +y axis.
            If None, then the initial value as specified in the `Axes3D`
            constructor is used.
        roll : float, default: None
            The roll angle in degrees rotates the camera about the viewing
            axis. A positive angle spins the camera clockwise, causing the
            scene to rotate counter-clockwise.
            If None, then the initial value as specified in the `Axes3D`
            constructor is used.
        vertical_axis : {"z", "x", "y"}, default: "z"
            The axis to align vertically. *azim* rotates about this axis.
        share : bool, default: False
            If ``True``, apply the settings to all Axes with shared views.
