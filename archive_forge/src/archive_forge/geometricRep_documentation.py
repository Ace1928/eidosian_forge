    Given a manifold M, retrieve the exact or numerical solutions to the
    Ptolemy variety (pass numerical = True for numerical solutions). The additional
    options are the same as the ones passed to retrieve_solutions of a PtolemyVariety.

    >>> from snappy.ptolemy.geometricRep import retrieve_geometric_solutions
    >>> retrieve_geometric_solutions(Manifold("m004")) #doctest: +SKIP
