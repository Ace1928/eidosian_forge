Compute current-flow betweenness centrality for edges.

    Current-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current
    model for information spreading in contrast to betweenness
    centrality which uses shortest paths.

    Current-flow betweenness centrality is also known as
    random-walk betweenness centrality [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph

    normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
      If True the betweenness values are normalized by 2/[(n-1)(n-2)] where
      n is the number of nodes in G.

    weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
      Key for edge data used as the edge weight.
      If None, then use 1 as each edge weight.
      The weight reflects the capacity or the strength of the
      edge.

    dtype : data type (default=float)
      Default data type for internal matrices.
      Set to np.float32 for lower memory consumption.

    solver : string (default='full')
       Type of linear solver to use for computing the flow matrix.
       Options are "full" (uses most memory), "lu" (recommended), and
       "cg" (uses least memory).

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of edge tuples with betweenness centrality as the value.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support DiGraphs.
        If the input graph is an instance of DiGraph class, NetworkXError
        is raised.

    Notes
    -----
    Current-flow betweenness can be computed in $O(I(n-1)+mn \log n)$
    time [1]_, where $I(n-1)$ is the time needed to compute the
    inverse Laplacian.  For a full matrix this is $O(n^3)$ but using
    sparse methods you can achieve $O(nm{\sqrt k})$ where $k$ is the
    Laplacian matrix condition number.

    The space required is $O(nw)$ where $w$ is the width of the sparse
    Laplacian matrix.  Worse case is $w=n$ for $O(n^2)$.

    If the edges have a 'weight' attribute they will be used as
    weights in this algorithm.  Unspecified weights are set to 1.
