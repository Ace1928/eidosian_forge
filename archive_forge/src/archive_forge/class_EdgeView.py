class EdgeView(OutEdgeView):
    """A EdgeView class for edges of a Graph

    This densely packed View allows iteration over edges, data lookup
    like a dict and set operations on edges represented by node-tuples.
    In addition, edge data can be controlled by calling this object
    possibly creating an EdgeDataView. Typically edges are iterated over
    and reported as `(u, v)` node tuples or `(u, v, key)` node/key tuples
    for multigraphs. Those edge representations can also be using to
    lookup the data dict for any edge. Set operations also are available
    where those tuples are the elements of the set.
    Calling this object with optional arguments `data`, `default` and `keys`
    controls the form of the tuple (see EdgeDataView). Optional argument
    `nbunch` allows restriction to edges only involving certain nodes.

    If `data is False` (the default) then iterate over 2-tuples `(u, v)`.
    If `data is True` iterate over 3-tuples `(u, v, datadict)`.
    Otherwise iterate over `(u, v, datadict.get(data, default))`.
    For Multigraphs, if `keys is True`, replace `u, v` with `u, v, key` above.

    Parameters
    ==========
    graph : NetworkX graph-like class
    nbunch : (default= all nodes in graph) only report edges with these nodes
    keys : (only for MultiGraph. default=False) report edge key in tuple
    data : bool or string (default=False) see above
    default : object (default=None)

    Examples
    ========
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> EV = G.edges()
    >>> (2, 3) in EV
    True
    >>> for u, v in EV:
    ...     print((u, v))
    (0, 1)
    (1, 2)
    (2, 3)
    >>> assert EV & {(1, 2), (3, 4)} == {(1, 2)}

    >>> EVdata = G.edges(data="color", default="aqua")
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3, color="blue")
    >>> assert (2, 3, "blue") in EVdata
    >>> for u, v, c in EVdata:
    ...     print(f"({u}, {v}) has color: {c}")
    (0, 1) has color: aqua
    (1, 2) has color: aqua
    (2, 3) has color: blue

    >>> EVnbunch = G.edges(nbunch=2)
    >>> assert (2, 3) in EVnbunch
    >>> assert (0, 1) not in EVnbunch
    >>> for u, v in EVnbunch:
    ...     assert u == 2 or v == 2

    >>> MG = nx.path_graph(4, create_using=nx.MultiGraph)
    >>> EVmulti = MG.edges(keys=True)
    >>> (2, 3, 0) in EVmulti
    True
    >>> (2, 3) in EVmulti  # 2-tuples work even when keys is True
    True
    >>> key = MG.add_edge(2, 3)
    >>> for u, v, k in EVmulti:
    ...     print((u, v, k))
    (0, 1, 0)
    (1, 2, 0)
    (2, 3, 0)
    (2, 3, 1)
