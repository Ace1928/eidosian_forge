    Linear programming: minimize a linear objective function subject to linear
    equality and inequality constraints using the tableau-based simplex method.

    .. deprecated:: 1.9.0
        `method='simplex'` will be removed in SciPy 1.11.0.
        It is replaced by `method='highs'` because the latter is
        faster and more robust.

    Linear programming solves problems of the following form:

    .. math::

        \min_x \ & c^T x \\
        \mbox{such that} \ & A_{ub} x \leq b_{ub},\\
        & A_{eq} x = b_{eq},\\
        & l \leq x \leq u ,

    where :math:`x` is a vector of decision variables; :math:`c`,
    :math:`b_{ub}`, :math:`b_{eq}`, :math:`l`, and :math:`u` are vectors; and
    :math:`A_{ub}` and :math:`A_{eq}` are matrices.

    Alternatively, that's:

    minimize::

        c @ x

    such that::

        A_ub @ x <= b_ub
        A_eq @ x == b_eq
        lb <= x <= ub

    Note that by default ``lb = 0`` and ``ub = None`` unless specified with
    ``bounds``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array
        The coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
    A_ub : 2-D array, optional
        The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_ub`` specifies the
        coefficients of a linear inequality constraint on ``x``.
    b_ub : 1-D array, optional
        The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an
        upper bound on the corresponding value of ``A_ub @ x``.
    A_eq : 2-D array, optional
        The equality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_eq`` specifies the
        coefficients of a linear equality constraint on ``x``.
    b_eq : 1-D array, optional
        The equality constraint vector. Each element of ``A_eq @ x`` must equal
        the corresponding element of ``b_eq``.
    bounds : sequence, optional
        A sequence of ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``, defining
        the minimum and maximum values of that decision variable. Use ``None``
        to indicate that there is no bound. By default, bounds are
        ``(0, None)`` (all decision variables are non-negative).
        If a single tuple ``(min, max)`` is provided, then ``min`` and
        ``max`` will serve as bounds for all decision variables.
    method : str
        This is the method-specific documentation for 'simplex'.
        :ref:`'highs' <optimize.linprog-highs>`,
        :ref:`'highs-ds' <optimize.linprog-highs-ds>`,
        :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs-ipm>`,
        :ref:`'interior-point' <optimize.linprog-interior-point>` (default),
        and :ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>`
        are also available.
    callback : callable, optional
        Callback function to be executed once per iteration.

    Options
    -------
    maxiter : int (default: 5000)
       The maximum number of iterations to perform in either phase.
    disp : bool (default: False)
        Set to ``True`` if indicators of optimization status are to be printed
        to the console each iteration.
    presolve : bool (default: True)
        Presolve attempts to identify trivial infeasibilities,
        identify trivial unboundedness, and simplify the problem before
        sending it to the main solver. It is generally recommended
        to keep the default setting ``True``; set to ``False`` if
        presolve is to be disabled.
    tol : float (default: 1e-12)
        The tolerance which determines when a solution is "close enough" to
        zero in Phase 1 to be considered a basic feasible solution or close
        enough to positive to serve as an optimal solution.
    autoscale : bool (default: False)
        Set to ``True`` to automatically perform equilibration.
        Consider using this option if the numerical values in the
        constraints are separated by several orders of magnitude.
    rr : bool (default: True)
        Set to ``False`` to disable automatic redundancy removal.
    bland : bool
        If True, use Bland's anti-cycling rule [3]_ to choose pivots to
        prevent cycling. If False, choose pivots which should lead to a
        converged solution more quickly. The latter method is subject to
        cycling (non-convergence) in rare instances.
    unknown_options : dict
        Optional arguments not used by this particular solver. If
        `unknown_options` is non-empty a warning is issued listing all
        unused options.

    Returns
    -------
    res : OptimizeResult
        A :class:`scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` consisting of the fields:

        x : 1-D array
            The values of the decision variables that minimizes the
            objective function while satisfying the constraints.
        fun : float
            The optimal value of the objective function ``c @ x``.
        slack : 1-D array
            The (nominally positive) values of the slack variables,
            ``b_ub - A_ub @ x``.
        con : 1-D array
            The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality constraints,
            ``b_eq - A_eq @ x``.
        success : bool
            ``True`` when the algorithm succeeds in finding an optimal
            solution.
        status : int
            An integer representing the exit status of the algorithm.

            ``0`` : Optimization terminated successfully.

            ``1`` : Iteration limit reached.

            ``2`` : Problem appears to be infeasible.

            ``3`` : Problem appears to be unbounded.

            ``4`` : Numerical difficulties encountered.

        message : str
            A string descriptor of the exit status of the algorithm.
        nit : int
            The total number of iterations performed in all phases.
