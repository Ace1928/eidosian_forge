def chebsub(c1, c2):
    """
    Subtract one Chebyshev series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Chebyshev series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    chebadd, chebmulx, chebmul, chebdiv, chebpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Chebyshev
    series is a Chebyshev series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> C.chebsub(c2,c1) # -C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])
