Run the wx event loop until the user provides more input.

    This input hook is suitable for use with wxPython >= 4 (a.k.a. Phoenix).

    It uses the same approach to that used in
    ipykernel.eventloops.loop_wx. The wx.MainLoop is executed, and a wx.Timer
    is used to periodically poll the context for input. As soon as input is
    ready, the wx.MainLoop is stopped.
