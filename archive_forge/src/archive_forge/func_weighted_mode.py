def weighted_mode(a, w, *, axis=0):
    """Return an array of the weighted modal (most common) value in the passed array.

    If there is more than one such value, only the first is returned.
    The bin-count for the modal bins is also returned.

    This is an extension of the algorithm in scipy.stats.mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Array of which values to find mode(s).
    w : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Array of weights for each value.
    axis : int, default=0
        Axis along which to operate. Default is 0, i.e. the first axis.

    Returns
    -------
    vals : ndarray
        Array of modal values.
    score : ndarray
        Array of weighted counts for each mode.

    See Also
    --------
    scipy.stats.mode: Calculates the Modal (most common) value of array elements
        along specified axis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.utils.extmath import weighted_mode
    >>> x = [4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2]
    >>> weights = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> weighted_mode(x, weights)
    (array([4.]), array([3.]))

    The value 4 appears three times: with uniform weights, the result is
    simply the mode of the distribution.

    >>> weights = [1, 3, 0.5, 1.5, 1, 2]  # deweight the 4's
    >>> weighted_mode(x, weights)
    (array([2.]), array([3.5]))

    The value 2 has the highest score: it appears twice with weights of
    1.5 and 2: the sum of these is 3.5.
