class Unequality(Relational):
    """An unequal relation between two objects.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Represents that two objects are not equal.  If they can be shown to be
    definitively equal, this will reduce to False; if definitively unequal,
    this will reduce to True.  Otherwise, the relation is maintained as an
    Unequality object.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Ne
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> Ne(y, x+x**2)
    Ne(y, x**2 + x)

    See Also
    ========
    Equality

    Notes
    =====
    This class is not the same as the != operator.  The != operator tests
    for exact structural equality between two expressions; this class
    compares expressions mathematically.

    This class is effectively the inverse of Equality.  As such, it uses the
    same algorithms, including any available `_eval_Eq` methods.
