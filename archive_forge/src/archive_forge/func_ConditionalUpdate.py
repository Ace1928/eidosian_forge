def ConditionalUpdate(self, request, global_params=None):
    """If a resource is found with the identifier specified in the query parameters, updates the entire contents of that resource. Implements the FHIR standard conditional update interaction, limited to searching by resource identifier. Search term for identifier should be in the pattern `identifier=system|value` or `identifier=value` - similar to the `search` method on resources with a specific identifier. If the search criteria identify more than one match, the request returns a `412 Precondition Failed` error. If the search criteria identify zero matches, and the supplied resource body contains an `id`, and the FHIR store has enable_update_create set, creates the resource with the client-specified ID. It is strongly advised not to include or encode any sensitive data such as patient identifiers in client-specified resource IDs. Those IDs are part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud Audit Logs and Pub/Sub notifications. Those IDs can also be contained in reference fields within other resources. If the search criteria identify zero matches, and the supplied resource body does not contain an `id`, the resource is created with a server-assigned ID as per the create method. The request body must contain a JSON-encoded FHIR resource, and the request headers must contain `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`. On success, the response body contains a JSON-encoded representation of the updated resource, including the server-assigned version ID. Errors generated by the FHIR store contain a JSON-encoded `OperationOutcome` resource describing the reason for the error. If the request cannot be mapped to a valid API method on a FHIR store, a generic GCP error might be returned instead. For samples that show how to call `conditionalUpdate`, see [Conditionally updating a FHIR resource](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/fhir-resources#conditionally_updating_a_fhir_resource).
