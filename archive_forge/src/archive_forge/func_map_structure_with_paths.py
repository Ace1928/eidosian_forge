def map_structure_with_paths(func, *structure, **kwargs):
    """Applies `func` to each entry in `structure` and returns a new structure.

  Applies `func(path, x[0], x[1], ..., **kwargs)` where x[i] is an entry in
  `structure[i]` and `path` is the common path to x[i] in the structures.  All
  structures in `structure` must have the same arity, and the return value will
  contain the results with the same structure layout. Special kwarg
  `check_types` determines whether the types of iterables within the structure
  must be the same-- see **kwargs definition below.

  Args:
    func: A callable with the signature func(path, *values, **kwargs) that is
      evaluated on the leaves of the structure.
    *structure: A variable number of compatible structures to process.
    **kwargs: Optional kwargs to be passed through to func. Special kwarg
      `check_types` is not passed to func, but instead determines whether the
      types of iterables within the structures have to be same (e.g.,
      `map_structure(func, [1], (1,))` raises a `TypeError` exception). By
      default, the types must match. To allow iteration over structures of
      different types (but common arity), set this kwarg to `False`.

  Returns:
    A structure of the same form as the input structures whose leaves are the
    result of evaluating func on corresponding leaves of the input structures.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `func` is not callable or if the structures do not match
      each other by depth tree.
    TypeError: If `check_types` is not `False` and the two structures differ in
      the type of sequence in any of their substructures.
    ValueError: If no structures are provided.
