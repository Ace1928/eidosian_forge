Create surface from a given lattice and Miller indices.

    lattice: Atoms object or str
        Bulk lattice structure of alloy or pure metal.  Note that the
        unit-cell must be the conventional cell - not the primitive cell.
        One can also give the chemical symbol as a string, in which case the
        correct bulk lattice will be generated automatically.
    indices: sequence of three int
        Surface normal in Miller indices (h,k,l).
    layers: int
        Number of equivalent layers of the slab.
    vacuum: float
        Amount of vacuum added on both sides of the slab.
    periodic: bool
        Whether the surface is periodic in the normal to the surface
