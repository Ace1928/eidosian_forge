Compute the particle number observable :math:`\hat{N}=\sum_\alpha \hat{n}_\alpha`
    in the Pauli basis.

    The particle number operator is given by

    .. math::

        \hat{N} = \sum_\alpha \hat{c}_\alpha^\dagger \hat{c}_\alpha,

    where the index :math:`\alpha` runs over the basis of single-particle states
    :math:`\vert \alpha \rangle`, and the operators :math:`\hat{c}^\dagger` and :math:`\hat{c}` are
    the particle creation and annihilation operators, respectively.

    Args:
        orbitals (int): Number of *spin* orbitals. If an active space is defined, this is
            the number of active spin-orbitals.

    Returns:
        pennylane.Hamiltonian: the particle number observable

    Raises:
        ValueError: If orbitals is less than or equal to 0

    **Example**

    >>> orbitals = 4
    >>> print(particle_number(orbitals))
    (2.0) [I0]

    + (-0.5) [Z1]
