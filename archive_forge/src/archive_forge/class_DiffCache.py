    Store for derivatives of expressions.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The standard form of the derivative of a Bessel function of order n
    contains two Bessel functions of orders n-1 and n+1, respectively.
    Such forms cannot be used in parallel Risch algorithm, because
    there is a linear recurrence relation between the three functions
    while the algorithm expects that functions and derivatives are
    represented in terms of algebraically independent transcendentals.

    The solution is to take two of the functions, e.g., those of orders
    n and n-1, and to express the derivatives in terms of the pair.
    To guarantee that the proper form is used the two derivatives are
    cached as soon as one is encountered.

    Derivatives of other functions are also cached at no extra cost.
    All derivatives are with respect to the same variable `x`.
