        Main method to featurize and prepare for the model.

        Args:
            audio (`np.ndarray`, `List`):
                The audio or batch of audio to be processed. Each audio can be a numpy array, a list of float values, a
                list of numpy arrays or a list of list of float values.
            sampling_rate (`int`):
                The sampling rate at which the `audio` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
                `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors.
            steps_per_beat (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):
                This is used in interpolating `beat_times`.
            resample (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Determines whether to resample the audio to `sampling_rate` or not before processing. Must be True
                during inference.
            return_attention_mask (`bool` *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Denotes if attention_mask for input_features, beatsteps and extrapolated_beatstep will be given as
                output or not. Automatically set to True for batched inputs.
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.
                If nothing is specified, it will return list of `np.ndarray` arrays.
