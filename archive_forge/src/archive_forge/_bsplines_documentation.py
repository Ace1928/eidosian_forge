Convolve with a 2-D separable FIR filter.

    Convolve the rank-2 input array with the separable filter defined by the
    rank-1 arrays hrow, and hcol. Mirror symmetric boundary conditions are
    assumed. This function can be used to find an image given its B-spline
    representation.

    The arguments `hrow` and `hcol` must be 1-dimensional and of off length.

    Args:
        input (cupy.ndarray): The input signal
        hrow (cupy.ndarray): Row direction filter
        hcol (cupy.ndarray): Column direction filter

    Returns:
        cupy.ndarray: The filtered signal
