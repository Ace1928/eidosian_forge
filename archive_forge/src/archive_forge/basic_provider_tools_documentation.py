Return the index string for Numpy.einsum matrix multiplication.

    The returned indices are to perform a matrix multiplication A.v where
    the matrix A is an M-qubit matrix, matrix v is an N-qubit vector, and
    M <= N, and identity matrices are implied on the subsystems where A has no
    support on v.

    Args:
        gate_indices (list[int]): the indices of the right matrix subsystems
                                   to contract with the left matrix.
        number_of_qubits (int): the total number of qubits for the right matrix.

    Returns:
        tuple: (mat_left, mat_right, tens_in, tens_out) of index strings for
        that may be combined into a Numpy.einsum function string.

    Raises:
        QiskitError: if the total number of qubits plus the number of
        contracted indices is greater than 26.
