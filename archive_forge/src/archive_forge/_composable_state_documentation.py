    Return the ``_State`` in ``model``.

    Given a ``module``, this API finds out if the module is also a ``_State``
    instance or if the module is managed by a composable API. If the module
    is also a ``_State``, ``module`` will be casted to ``_State` and returned.
    If it is managed by a composable API, the corresponding ``_State`` will
    be returned.
