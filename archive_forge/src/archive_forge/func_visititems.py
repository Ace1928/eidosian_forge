    """ Recursively visit names and objects in this group.

        You supply a callable (function, method or callable object); it
        will be called exactly once for each link in this group and every
        group below it. Your callable must conform to the signature:

            func(<member name>, <object>) => <None or return value>

        Returning None continues iteration, returning anything else stops
        and immediately returns that value from the visit method.  No
        particular order of iteration within groups is guaranteed.

        Example:

        # Get a list of all datasets in the file
        >>> mylist = []
        >>> def func(name, obj):
        ...     if isinstance(obj, Dataset):
        ...         mylist.append(name)
        ...
