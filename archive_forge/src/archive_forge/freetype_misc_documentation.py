Next time you're reading something. Think of them.


Herein lies a *BOLD* demo consisting of a mixture of various things.

        Not only is it a *BOLD* demo, it's an
        italics demo,
        a rotated demo,
        it's a blend,
        and is sized to go nicely with a cup of tea*.

        * also goes well with coffee.

Enjoy!
