This class implements the FSHP password hash, and follows the :ref:`password-hash-api`.

    It supports a variable-length salt, and a variable number of rounds.

    The :meth:`~passlib.ifc.PasswordHash.using` method accepts the following optional keywords:

    :param salt:
        Optional raw salt string.
        If not specified, one will be autogenerated (this is recommended).

    :param salt_size:
        Optional number of bytes to use when autogenerating new salts.
        Defaults to 16 bytes, but can be any non-negative value.

    :param rounds:
        Optional number of rounds to use.
        Defaults to 480000, must be between 1 and 4294967295, inclusive.

    :param variant:
        Optionally specifies variant of FSHP to use.

        * ``0`` - uses SHA-1 digest (deprecated).
        * ``1`` - uses SHA-2/256 digest (default).
        * ``2`` - uses SHA-2/384 digest.
        * ``3`` - uses SHA-2/512 digest.

    :type relaxed: bool
    :param relaxed:
        By default, providing an invalid value for one of the other
        keywords will result in a :exc:`ValueError`. If ``relaxed=True``,
        and the error can be corrected, a :exc:`~passlib.exc.PasslibHashWarning`
        will be issued instead. Correctable errors include ``rounds``
        that are too small or too large, and ``salt`` strings that are too long.
