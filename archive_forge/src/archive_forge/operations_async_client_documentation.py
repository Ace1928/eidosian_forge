Deletes a long-running operation.

        This method indicates that the client is no longer interested in the
        operation result. It does not cancel the operation.

        Example:
            >>> from google.api_core import operations_v1
            >>> api = operations_v1.OperationsClient()
            >>> name = ''
            >>> api.delete_operation(name)

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the operation resource to be deleted.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): The retry strategy to use
                when invoking the RPC. If unspecified, the default retry from
                the client configuration will be used. If ``None``, then this
                method will not retry the RPC at all.
            timeout (float): The amount of time in seconds to wait for the RPC
                to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is used, this timeout
                applies to each individual attempt and the overall time it
                takes for this method to complete may be longer. If
                unspecified, the the default timeout in the client
                configuration is used. If ``None``, then the RPC method will
                not time out.
            compression (grpc.Compression): An element of grpc.compression
                e.g. grpc.compression.Gzip.
            metadata (Optional[List[Tuple[str, str]]]): Additional gRPC
                metadata.

        Raises:
            google.api_core.exceptions.MethodNotImplemented: If the server
                does not support this method. Services are not required to
                implement this method.
            google.api_core.exceptions.GoogleAPICallError: If an error occurred
                while invoking the RPC, the appropriate ``GoogleAPICallError``
                subclass will be raised.
