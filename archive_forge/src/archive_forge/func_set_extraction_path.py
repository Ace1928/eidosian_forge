        is based on the ``PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`` environment variable, with various
        platform-specific fallbacks.  See that routine's documentation for more
        details.)

        Resources are extracted to subdirectories of this path based upon
        information given by the ``IResourceProvider``.  You may set this to a
        temporary directory, but then you must call ``cleanup_resources()`` to
        delete the extracted files when done.  There is no guarantee that
        ``cleanup_resources()`` will be able to remove all extracted files.

        (Note: you may not change the extraction path for a given resource
        manager once resources have been extracted, unless you first call
        ``cleanup_resources()``.)
