    """Compute closeness centrality for nodes.

    Closeness centrality [1]_ of a node `u` is the reciprocal of the
    average shortest path distance to `u` over all `n-1` reachable nodes.

    .. math::

        C(u) = \\frac{n - 1}{\\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},

    where `d(v, u)` is the shortest-path distance between `v` and `u`,
    and `n-1` is the number of nodes reachable from `u`. Notice that the
    closeness distance function computes the incoming distance to `u`
    for directed graphs. To use outward distance, act on `G.reverse()`.

    Notice that higher values of closeness indicate higher centrality.

    Wasserman and Faust propose an improved formula for graphs with
    more than one connected component. The result is "a ratio of the
    fraction of actors in the group who are reachable, to the average
    distance" from the reachable actors [2]_. You might think this
    scale factor is inverted but it is not. As is, nodes from small
    components receive a smaller closeness value. Letting `N` denote
    the number of nodes in the graph,

    .. math::

        C_{WF}(u) = \\frac{n-1}{N-1} \\frac{n - 1}{\\sum_{v=1}^{n-1} d(v, u)},

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph

    u : node, optional
      Return only the value for node u

    distance : edge attribute key, optional (default=None)
      Use the specified edge attribute as the edge distance in shortest
      path calculations.  If `None` (the default) all edges have a distance of 1.
      Absent edge attributes are assigned a distance of 1. Note that no check
      is performed to ensure that edges have the provided attribute.

    wf_improved : bool, optional (default=True)
      If True, scale by the fraction of nodes reachable. This gives the
      Wasserman and Faust improved formula. For single component graphs
      it is the same as the original formula.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
      Dictionary of nodes with closeness centrality as the value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> nx.closeness_centrality(G)
    {0: 1.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 0.75, 3: 0.75}

    degree_centrality, incremental_closeness_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The closeness centrality is normalized to `(n-1)/(|G|-1)` where
    `n` is the number of nodes in the connected part of graph
    containing the node.  If the graph is not completely connected,
    this algorithm computes the closeness centrality for each
    connected part separately scaled by that parts size.

    If the 'distance' keyword is set to an edge attribute key then the
    shortest-path length will be computed using Dijkstra's algorithm with
    that edge attribute as the edge weight.

    The closeness centrality uses *inward* distance to a node, not outward.
    If you want to use outword distances apply the function to `G.reverse()`

    In NetworkX 2.2 and earlier a bug caused Dijkstra's algorithm to use the
    outward distance rather than the inward distance. If you use a 'distance'
    keyword and a DiGraph, your results will change between v2.2 and v2.3.
