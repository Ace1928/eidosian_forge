    """
    Represents a morphism which has a name.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Names are used to distinguish between morphisms which have the
    same domain and codomain: two named morphisms are equal if they
    have the same domains, codomains, and names.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.categories import Object, NamedMorphism
    >>> A = Object("A")
    >>> B = Object("B")
    >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
    >>> f
    NamedMorphism(Object("A"), Object("B"), "f")
    >>> f.name
    'f'
