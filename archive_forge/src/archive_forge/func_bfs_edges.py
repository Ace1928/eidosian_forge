def bfs_edges(G, source, reverse=False, depth_limit=None, sort_neighbors=None):
    """Iterate over edges in a breadth-first-search starting at source.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Specify starting node for breadth-first search; this function
       iterates over only those edges in the component reachable from
       this node.

    reverse : bool, optional
       If True traverse a directed graph in the reverse direction

    depth_limit : int, optional(default=len(G))
        Specify the maximum search depth

    sort_neighbors : function
        A function that takes the list of neighbors of given node as input, and
        returns an *iterator* over these neighbors but with custom ordering.

    Yields
    ------
    edge: 2-tuple of nodes
       Yields edges resulting from the breadth-first search.

    Examples
    --------
    To get the edges in a breadth-first search::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> list(nx.bfs_edges(G, 0))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2)]
        >>> list(nx.bfs_edges(G, source=0, depth_limit=1))
        [(0, 1)]

    To get the nodes in a breadth-first search order::

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> root = 2
        >>> edges = nx.bfs_edges(G, root)
        >>> nodes = [root] + [v for u, v in edges]
        >>> nodes
        [2, 1, 0]

    Notes
    -----
    The naming of this function is very similar to
    :func:`~networkx.algorithms.traversal.edgebfs.edge_bfs`. The difference
    is that ``edge_bfs`` yields edges even if they extend back to an already
    explored node while this generator yields the edges of the tree that results
    from a breadth-first-search (BFS) so no edges are reported if they extend
    to already explored nodes. That means ``edge_bfs`` reports all edges while
    ``bfs_edges`` only reports those traversed by a node-based BFS. Yet another
    description is that ``bfs_edges`` reports the edges traversed during BFS
    while ``edge_bfs`` reports all edges in the order they are explored.

    Based on the breadth-first search implementation in PADS [1]_
    by D. Eppstein, July 2004; with modifications to allow depth limits
    as described in [2]_.
