VGG-19_BN from `Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556>`__.

    Args:
        weights (:class:`~torchvision.models.VGG19_BN_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights to use. See
            :class:`~torchvision.models.VGG19_BN_Weights` below for
            more details, and possible values. By default, no pre-trained
            weights are used.
        progress (bool, optional): If True, displays a progress bar of the
            download to stderr. Default is True.
        **kwargs: parameters passed to the ``torchvision.models.vgg.VGG``
            base class. Please refer to the `source code
            <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/vgg.py>`_
            for more details about this class.
