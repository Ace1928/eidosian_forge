Return a copy of G completed to a chordal graph

    Adds edges to a copy of G to create a chordal graph. A graph G=(V,E) is
    called chordal if for each cycle with length bigger than 3, there exist
    two non-adjacent nodes connected by an edge (called a chord).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    H : NetworkX graph
        The chordal enhancement of G
    alpha : Dictionary
            The elimination ordering of nodes of G

    Notes
    -----
    There are different approaches to calculate the chordal
    enhancement of a graph. The algorithm used here is called
    MCS-M and gives at least minimal (local) triangulation of graph. Note
    that this triangulation is not necessarily a global minimum.
