def lagsub(c1, c2):
    """
    Subtract one Laguerre series from another.

    Returns the difference of two Laguerre series `c1` - `c2`.  The
    sequences of coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
    [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing their difference.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagmulx, lagmul, lagdiv, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Laguerre
    series is a Laguerre series (without having to "reproject" the result
    onto the basis set) so subtraction, just like that of "standard"
    polynomials, is simply "component-wise."

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagsub
    >>> lagsub([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
    array([0.,  0.,  0.,  4.])
