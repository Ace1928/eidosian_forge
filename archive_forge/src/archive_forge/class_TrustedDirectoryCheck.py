    """A trusted directory check, which rejects images that do not come from
  the set of user-configured trusted directories.

  Fields:
    trustedDirPatterns: Required. List of trusted directory patterns. A
      pattern is in the form "registry/path/to/directory". The registry domain
      part is defined as two or more dot-separated words, e.g., `us.pkg.dev`,
      or `gcr.io`. Additionally, `*` can be used in three ways as wildcards:
      1. leading `*` to match varying prefixes in registry subdomain (useful
      for location prefixes); 2. trailing `*` after registry/ to match varying
      endings; 3. trailing `**` after registry/ to match "/" as well. For
      example: -- `gcr.io/my-project/my-repo` is valid to match a single
      directory -- `*-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo` or `*.gcr.io/my-
      project` are valid to match varying prefixes -- `gcr.io/my-project/*`
      will match all direct directories in `my-project` -- `gcr.io/my-
      project/**` would match all directories in `my-project` -- `gcr.i*` is
      not allowed since the registry is not completely specified --
      `sub*domain.gcr.io/nginx` is not valid because only leading `*` or
      trailing `*` are allowed. -- `*pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo` is not valid
      because leading `*` can only match subdomain -- `**-docker.pkg.dev` is
      not valid because one leading `*` is allowed, and that it cannot match
      `/`
