class BaseModelOutputWithAttentionMask(ModelOutput):
    """
    Class for the model's outputs that may also contain a past key/values (to speed up sequential decoding). Includes
    an additional attention mask.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model. If `past_key_values` is used only
            the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1, hidden_size)` is output.
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or
        when `config.use_cache=True`):
            Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape
            `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and optionally if
            `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` 2 additional tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads,
            encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`. Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the
            self-attention blocks and optionally if `config.is_encoder_decoder=True` in the cross-attention blocks)
            that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
        hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or
        when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. Hidden-states of
            the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when
        `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in
            the self-attention heads.
        cross_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` and
        `config.add_cross_attention=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax,
            used to compute the weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
