from torch.distributed.elastic.timer.api import TimerClient, TimerRequest

    Server that works with ``FileTimerClient``. Clients are expected to be
    running on the same host as the process that is running this server.
    Each host in the job is expected to start its own timer server locally
    and each server instance manages timers for local workers (running on
    processes on the same host).

    Args:

        file_path: str, the path of a FIFO special file to be created.

        max_interval: float, max interval in seconds for each watchdog loop.

        daemon: bool, running the watchdog thread in daemon mode or not.
                      A daemon thread will not block a process to stop.
        log_event: Callable[[Dict[str, str]], None], an optional callback for
                logging the events in JSON format.
