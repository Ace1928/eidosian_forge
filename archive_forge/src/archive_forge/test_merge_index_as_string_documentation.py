    Compute the expected merge result for the test case.

    This method computes the expected result of merging two DataFrames on
    a combination of their columns and index levels. It does so by
    explicitly dropping/resetting their named index levels, performing a
    merge on their columns, and then finally restoring the appropriate
    index in the result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df_left : DataFrame
        The left DataFrame (may have zero or more named index levels)
    df_right : DataFrame
        The right DataFrame (may have zero or more named index levels)
    on : list of str
        The on parameter to the merge operation
    left_on : list of str
        The left_on parameter to the merge operation
    right_on : list of str
        The right_on parameter to the merge operation
    how : str
        The how parameter to the merge operation

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        The expected merge result
