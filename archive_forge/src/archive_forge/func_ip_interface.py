    Args:
        address: A string or integer, the IP address.  Either IPv4 or
          IPv6 addresses may be supplied; integers less than 2**32 will
          be considered to be IPv4 by default.

        An IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface object.

          address.

    Notes:
        The IPv?Interface classes describe an Address on a particular
        Network, so they're basically a combination of both the Address
        and Network classes.
