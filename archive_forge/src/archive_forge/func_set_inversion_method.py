        Set the inversion method

        The Kalman filter may contain one matrix inversion: that of the
        forecast error covariance matrix. The inversion method controls how and
        if that inverse is performed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inversion_method : int, optional
            Bitmask value to set the inversion method to. See notes for
            details.
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments may be used to influence the inversion method by
            setting individual boolean flags. See notes for details.

        Notes
        -----
        The inversion method is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        INVERT_UNIVARIATE
            If the endogenous time series is univariate, then inversion can be
            performed by simple division. If this flag is set and the time
            series is univariate, then division will always be used even if
            other flags are also set.
        SOLVE_LU
            Use an LU decomposition along with a linear solver (rather than
            ever actually inverting the matrix).
        INVERT_LU
            Use an LU decomposition along with typical matrix inversion.
        SOLVE_CHOLESKY
            Use a Cholesky decomposition along with a linear solver.
        INVERT_CHOLESKY
            Use an Cholesky decomposition along with typical matrix inversion.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `inversion_method` argument,
        then the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the inversion method may also be specified by directly
        modifying the class attributes which are defined similarly to the
        keyword arguments.

        The default inversion method is `INVERT_UNIVARIATE | SOLVE_CHOLESKY`

        Several things to keep in mind are:

        - If the filtering method is specified to be univariate, then simple
          division is always used regardless of the dimension of the endogenous
          time series.
        - Cholesky decomposition is about twice as fast as LU decomposition,
          but it requires that the matrix be positive definite. While this
          should generally be true, it may not be in every case.
        - Using a linear solver rather than true matrix inversion is generally
          faster and is numerically more stable.

        >>> mod.ssm.solve_cholesky
        True
        >>> mod.ssm.invert_univariate
        True
        >>> mod.ssm.invert_lu
        False
        >>> mod.ssm.invert_univariate = False
        >>> mod.ssm.inversion_method
        8
        >>> mod.ssm.set_inversion_method(solve_cholesky=False,
        ...                              invert_cholesky=True)
