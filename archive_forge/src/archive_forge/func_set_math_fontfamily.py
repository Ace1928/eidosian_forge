def set_math_fontfamily(self, fontfamily):
    """
        Set the font family for math text rendered by Matplotlib.

        This does only affect Matplotlib's own math renderer. It has no effect
        when rendering with TeX (``usetex=True``).

        Parameters
        ----------
        fontfamily : str
            The name of the font family.

            Available font families are defined in the
            :ref:`default matplotlibrc file
            <customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files>`.
