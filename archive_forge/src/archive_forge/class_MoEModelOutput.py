class MoEModelOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs, with potential hidden states and attentions.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, +
            one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
        router_probs (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_router_probs=True` and `config.add_router_probs=True` is passed or when `config.output_router_probs=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_experts)`.

            Raw router probabilities that are computed by MoE routers, these terms are used to compute the auxiliary
            loss and the z_loss for Mixture of Experts models.
