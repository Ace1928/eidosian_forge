    Assign a 5-item fingerprint to each symbol in the equation:
    [
    # of times it appeared as a Symbol;
    # of times it appeared as a Not(symbol);
    # of times it appeared as a Symbol in an And or Or;
    # of times it appeared as a Not(Symbol) in an And or Or;
    a sorted tuple of tuples, (i, j, k), where i is the number of arguments
    in an And or Or with which it appeared as a Symbol, and j is
    the number of arguments that were Not(Symbol); k is the number
    of times that (i, j) was seen.

    >>> from sympy.logic.boolalg import _finger as finger
    >>> from sympy import And, Or, Not, Xor, to_cnf, symbols
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, x, y
    >>> eq = Or(And(Not(y), a), And(Not(y), b), And(x, y))
    >>> dict(finger(eq))
    {(0, 0, 1, 0, ((2, 0, 1),)): [x],
    (0, 0, 1, 0, ((2, 1, 1),)): [a, b],
    (0, 0, 1, 2, ((2, 0, 1),)): [y]}
    >>> dict(finger(x & ~y))
    {(0, 1, 0, 0, ()): [y], (1, 0, 0, 0, ()): [x]}

    In the following, the (5, 2, 6) means that there were 6 Or
    functions in which a symbol appeared as itself amongst 5 arguments in
    which there were also 2 negated symbols, e.g. ``(a0 | a1 | a2 | ~a3 | ~a4)``
    is counted once for a0, a1 and a2.

    >>> dict(finger(to_cnf(Xor(*symbols('a:5')))))
    {(0, 0, 8, 8, ((5, 0, 1), (5, 2, 6), (5, 4, 1))): [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4]}

    The equation must not have more than one level of nesting:

    >>> dict(finger(And(Or(x, y), y)))
    {(0, 0, 1, 0, ((2, 0, 1),)): [x], (1, 0, 1, 0, ((2, 0, 1),)): [y]}
    >>> dict(finger(And(Or(x, And(a, x)), y)))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError: unexpected level of nesting

    So y and x have unique fingerprints, but a and b do not.
