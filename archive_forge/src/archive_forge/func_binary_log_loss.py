    This is identical to log_loss in binary classification case,

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Ground truth (correct) labels.

    y_prob : array-like of float, shape = (n_samples, 1)
        Predicted probabilities, as returned by a classifier's
        predict_proba method.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float
        The degree to which the samples are correctly predicted.
