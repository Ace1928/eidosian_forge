Returns global timesteps at which an agent stepped.

        The function returns for a given list of indices the ones
        that are stored in the `IndexMapping`.

        Args:
            indices_to_find: A list of indices that should be
                found in the `IndexMapping`.

        Returns:
            A list of indices at which to find the `indices_to_find`
            in `self`. This could be empty if none of the given
            indices are in `IndexMapping`.
