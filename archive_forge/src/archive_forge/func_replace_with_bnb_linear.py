def replace_with_bnb_linear(model, modules_to_not_convert=None, current_key_name=None, quantization_config=None):
    """
    A helper function to replace all `torch.nn.Linear` modules by `bnb.nn.Linear8bit` modules from the `bitsandbytes`
    library. This will enable running your models using mixed int8 precision as described by the paper `LLM.int8():
    8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale`. Make sure `bitsandbytes` compiled with the correct CUDA
    version of your hardware is installed before running this function. `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/
    bitsandbytes`

    The function will be run recursively and replace all `torch.nn.Linear` modules except for the `lm_head` that should
    be kept as a `torch.nn.Linear` module. The replacement is done under `init_empty_weights` context manager so no
    CPU/GPU memory is required to run this function. Int8 mixed-precision matrix decomposition works by separating a
    matrix multiplication into two streams: (1) and systematic feature outlier stream matrix multiplied in fp16
    (0.01%), (2) a regular stream of int8 matrix multiplication (99.9%). With this method, int8 inference with no
    predictive degradation is possible for very large models (>=176B parameters).

    Parameters:
        model (`torch.nn.Module`):
            Input model or `torch.nn.Module` as the function is run recursively.
        modules_to_not_convert (`List[`str`]`, *optional*, defaults to `["lm_head"]`):
            Names of the modules to not convert in `Linear8bitLt`. In practice we keep the `lm_head` in full precision
            for numerical stability reasons.
        current_key_name (`List[`str`]`, *optional*):
            An array to track the current key of the recursion. This is used to check whether the current key (part of
            it) is not in the list of modules to not convert (for instances modules that are offloaded to `cpu` or
            `disk`).
