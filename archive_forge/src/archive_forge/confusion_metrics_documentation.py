Interpolation formula inspired by section 4 of Davis & Goadrich 2006.

        https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~page/rocpr.pdf

        Note here we derive & use a closed formula not present in the paper
        as follows:

          Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = TP / P

        Modeling all of TP (true positive), FP (false positive) and their sum
        P = TP + FP (predicted positive) as varying linearly within each
        interval [A, B] between successive thresholds, we get

          Precision slope = dTP / dP
                          = (TP_B - TP_A) / (P_B - P_A)
                          = (TP - TP_A) / (P - P_A)
          Precision = (TP_A + slope * (P - P_A)) / P

        The area within the interval is (slope / total_pos_weight) times

          int_A^B{Precision.dP} = int_A^B{(TP_A + slope * (P - P_A)) * dP / P}
          int_A^B{Precision.dP} = int_A^B{slope * dP + intercept * dP / P}

        where intercept = TP_A - slope * P_A = TP_B - slope * P_B, resulting in

          int_A^B{Precision.dP} = TP_B - TP_A + intercept * log(P_B / P_A)

        Bringing back the factor (slope / total_pos_weight) we'd put aside, we
        get

          slope * [dTP + intercept *  log(P_B / P_A)] / total_pos_weight

        where dTP == TP_B - TP_A.

        Note that when P_A == 0 the above calculation simplifies into

          int_A^B{Precision.dTP} = int_A^B{slope * dTP} = slope * (TP_B - TP_A)

        which is really equivalent to imputing constant precision throughout the
        first bucket having >0 true positives.

        Returns:
          pr_auc: an approximation of the area under the P-R curve.
