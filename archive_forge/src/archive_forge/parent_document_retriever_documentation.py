Adds documents to the docstore and vectorstores.

        Args:
            documents: List of documents to add
            ids: Optional list of ids for documents. If provided should be the same
                length as the list of documents. Can be provided if parent documents
                are already in the document store and you don't want to re-add
                to the docstore. If not provided, random UUIDs will be used as
                ids.
            add_to_docstore: Boolean of whether to add documents to docstore.
                This can be false if and only if `ids` are provided. You may want
                to set this to False if the documents are already in the docstore
                and you don't want to re-add them.
