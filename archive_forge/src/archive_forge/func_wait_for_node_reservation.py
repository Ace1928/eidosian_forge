def wait_for_node_reservation(self, node, timeout=None):
    """Wait for a lock on the node to be released.

        Bare metal nodes in ironic have a reservation lock that
        is used to represent that a conductor has locked the node
        while performing some sort of action, such as changing
        configuration as a result of a machine state change.

        This lock can occur during power syncronization, and prevents
        updates to objects attached to the node, such as ports.

        Note that nothing prevents a conductor from acquiring the lock again
        after this call returns, so it should be treated as best effort.

        Returns immediately if there is no reservation on the node.

        :param node: The value can be the name or ID of a node or a
            :class:`~openstack.baremetal.v1.node.Node` instance.
        :param timeout: How much (in seconds) to wait for the lock to be
            released. The value of ``None`` (the default) means no timeout.

        :returns: The updated :class:`~openstack.baremetal.v1.node.Node`
