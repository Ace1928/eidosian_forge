def is_chordal(G):
    """Checks whether G is a chordal graph.

    A graph is chordal if every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord
    (an edge joining two nodes not adjacent in the cycle).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph.

    Returns
    -------
    chordal : bool
      True if G is a chordal graph and False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> e = [
    ...     (1, 2),
    ...     (1, 3),
    ...     (2, 3),
    ...     (2, 4),
    ...     (3, 4),
    ...     (3, 5),
    ...     (3, 6),
    ...     (4, 5),
    ...     (4, 6),
    ...     (5, 6),
    ... ]
    >>> G = nx.Graph(e)
    >>> nx.is_chordal(G)
    True

    Notes
    -----
    The routine tries to go through every node following maximum cardinality
    search. It returns False when it finds that the separator for any node
    is not a clique.  Based on the algorithms in [1]_.

    Self loops are ignored.
