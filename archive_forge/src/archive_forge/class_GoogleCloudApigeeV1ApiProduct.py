class GoogleCloudApigeeV1ApiProduct(_messages.Message):
    """A GoogleCloudApigeeV1ApiProduct object.

  Enums:
    QuotaCounterScopeValueValuesEnum: Scope of the quota decides how the quota
      counter gets applied and evaluate for quota violation. If the Scope is
      set as PROXY, then all the operations defined for the APIproduct that
      are associated with the same proxy will share the same quota counter set
      at the APIproduct level, making it a global counter at a proxy level. If
      the Scope is set as OPERATION, then each operations get the counter set
      at the API product dedicated, making it a local counter. Note that, the
      QuotaCounterScope applies only when an operation does not have dedicated
      quota set for itself.

  Fields:
    apiResources: Comma-separated list of API resources to be bundled in the
      API product. By default, the resource paths are mapped from the
      `proxy.pathsuffix` variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the URI
      fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if the
      `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path
      defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to
      `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select
      a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following
      wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` :
      Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, /
      supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by
      the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is
      `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to
      `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as
      `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so
      on. For more information, see Managing API products.
    approvalType: Flag that specifies how API keys are approved to access the
      APIs defined by the API product. If set to `manual`, the consumer key is
      generated and returned in "pending" state. In this case, the API keys
      won't work until they have been explicitly approved. If set to `auto`,
      the consumer key is generated and returned in "approved" state and can
      be used immediately. **Note:** Typically, `auto` is used to provide
      access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or
      capabilities.
    attributes: Array of attributes that may be used to extend the default API
      product profile with customer-specific metadata. You can specify a
      maximum of 18 attributes. Use this property to specify the access level
      of the API product as either `public`, `private`, or `internal`. Only
      products marked `public` are available to developers in the Apigee
      developer portal. For example, you can set a product to `internal` while
      it is in development and then change access to `public` when it is ready
      to release on the portal. API products marked as `private` do not appear
      on the portal, but can be accessed by external developers.
    createdAt: Response only. Creation time of this environment as
      milliseconds since epoch.
    description: Description of the API product. Include key information about
      the API product that is not captured by other fields.
    displayName: Name displayed in the UI or developer portal to developers
      registering for API access.
    environments: Comma-separated list of environment names to which the API
      product is bound. Requests to environments that are not listed are
      rejected. By specifying one or more environments, you can bind the
      resources listed in the API product to a specific environment,
      preventing developers from accessing those resources through API proxies
      deployed in another environment. This setting is used, for example, to
      prevent resources associated with API proxies in `prod` from being
      accessed by API proxies deployed in `test`.
    graphqlOperationGroup: Configuration used to group Apigee proxies or
      remote services with graphQL operation name, graphQL operation type and
      quotas. This grouping allows us to precisely set quota for a particular
      combination of graphQL name and operation type for a particular proxy
      request. If graphQL name is not set, this would imply quota will be
      applied on all graphQL requests matching the operation type.
    grpcOperationGroup: Optional. Configuration used to group Apigee proxies
      with gRPC services and method names. This grouping allows us to set
      quota for a particular proxy with the gRPC service name and method. If a
      method name is not set, this implies quota and authorization are applied
      to all gRPC methods implemented by that proxy for that particular gRPC
      service.
    lastModifiedAt: Response only. Modified time of this environment as
      milliseconds since epoch.
    name: Internal name of the API product. Characters you can use in the name
      are restricted to: `A-Z0-9._\\-$ %`. **Note:** The internal name cannot
      be edited when updating the API product.
    operationGroup: Configuration used to group Apigee proxies or remote
      services with resources, method types, and quotas. The resource refers
      to the resource URI (excluding the base path). With this grouping, the
      API product creator is able to fine-tune and give precise control over
      which REST methods have access to specific resources and how many calls
      can be made (using the `quota` setting). **Note:** The `api_resources`
      setting cannot be specified for both the API product and operation
      group; otherwise the call will fail.
    proxies: Comma-separated list of API proxy names to which this API product
      is bound. By specifying API proxies, you can associate resources in the
      API product with specific API proxies, preventing developers from
      accessing those resources through other API proxies. Apigee rejects
      requests to API proxies that are not listed. **Note:** The API proxy
      names must already exist in the specified environment as they will be
      validated upon creation.
    quota: Number of request messages permitted per app by this API product
      for the specified `quotaInterval` and `quotaTimeUnit`. For example, a
      `quota` of 50, for a `quotaInterval` of 12 and a `quotaTimeUnit` of
      hours means 50 requests are allowed every 12 hours.
    quotaCounterScope: Scope of the quota decides how the quota counter gets
      applied and evaluate for quota violation. If the Scope is set as PROXY,
      then all the operations defined for the APIproduct that are associated
      with the same proxy will share the same quota counter set at the
      APIproduct level, making it a global counter at a proxy level. If the
      Scope is set as OPERATION, then each operations get the counter set at
      the API product dedicated, making it a local counter. Note that, the
      QuotaCounterScope applies only when an operation does not have dedicated
      quota set for itself.
    quotaInterval: Time interval over which the number of request messages is
      calculated.
    quotaTimeUnit: Time unit defined for the `quotaInterval`. Valid values
      include `minute`, `hour`, `day`, or `month`.
    scopes: Comma-separated list of OAuth scopes that are validated at
      runtime. Apigee validates that the scopes in any access token presented
      match the scopes defined in the OAuth policy associated with the API
      product.
    spaceId: Optional. The resource ID of the parent Space. If not set, the
      parent resource will be the Organization. TODO b/329340109 remove
      TRUSTED_TESTER to make API available in prod
