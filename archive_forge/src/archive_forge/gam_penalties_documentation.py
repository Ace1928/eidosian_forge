penalty matrix for generalized additive model

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : list of floats or None
            penalty weights

        Returns
        -------
        penalty matrix
            block diagonal, square penalty matrix for quadratic penalization.
            The number of rows and columns are equal to the number of
            parameters in the regression model ``k_params``.

        Notes
        -----
        statsmodels does not support backwards compatibility when keywords are
        used as positional arguments. The order of keywords might change.
        We might need to add a ``params`` keyword if the need arises.
