    """
    Compare images generated by the test with those specified in
    *baseline_images*, which must correspond, else an `ImageComparisonFailure`
    exception will be raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    baseline_images : list or None
        A list of strings specifying the names of the images generated by
        calls to `.Figure.savefig`.

        If *None*, the test function must use the ``baseline_images`` fixture,
        either as a parameter or with `pytest.mark.usefixtures`. This value is
        only allowed when using pytest.

    extensions : None or list of str
        The list of extensions to test, e.g. ``['png', 'pdf']``.

        If *None*, defaults to all supported extensions: png, pdf, and svg.

        When testing a single extension, it can be directly included in the
        names passed to *baseline_images*.  In that case, *extensions* must not
        be set.

        In order to keep the size of the test suite from ballooning, we only
        include the ``svg`` or ``pdf`` outputs if the test is explicitly
        exercising a feature dependent on that backend (see also the
        `check_figures_equal` decorator for that purpose).

    tol : float, default: 0
        The RMS threshold above which the test is considered failed.

        Due to expected small differences in floating-point calculations, on
        32-bit systems an additional 0.06 is added to this threshold.

    freetype_version : str or tuple
        The expected freetype version or range of versions for this test to
        pass.

    remove_text : bool
        Remove the title and tick text from the figure before comparison.  This
        is useful to make the baseline images independent of variations in text
        rendering between different versions of FreeType.

        This does not remove other, more deliberate, text, such as legends and
        annotations.

    savefig_kwarg : dict
        Optional arguments that are passed to the savefig method.

    style : str, dict, or list
        The optional style(s) to apply to the image test. The test itself
        can also apply additional styles if desired. Defaults to ``["classic",
        "_classic_test_patch"]``.
