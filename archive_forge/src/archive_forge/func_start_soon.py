def start_soon(self, async_fn: Callable[[Unpack[PosArgT]], Awaitable[object]], *args: Unpack[PosArgT], name: object=None) -> None:
    """Creates a child task, scheduling ``await async_fn(*args)``.

        If you want to run a function and immediately wait for its result,
        then you don't need a nursery; just use ``await async_fn(*args)``.
        If you want to wait for the task to initialize itself before
        continuing, see :meth:`start`, the other fundamental method for
        creating concurrent tasks in Trio.

        Note that this is *not* an async function and you don't use await
        when calling it. It sets up the new task, but then returns
        immediately, *before* the new task has a chance to do anything.
        New tasks may start running in any order, and at any checkpoint the
        scheduler chooses - at latest when the nursery is waiting to exit.

        It's possible to pass a nursery object into another task, which
        allows that task to start new child tasks in the first task's
        nursery.

        The child task inherits its parent nursery's cancel scopes.

        Args:
            async_fn: An async callable.
            args: Positional arguments for ``async_fn``. If you want
                  to pass keyword arguments, use
                  :func:`functools.partial`.
            name: The name for this task. Only used for
                  debugging/introspection
                  (e.g. ``repr(task_obj)``). If this isn't a string,
                  :meth:`start_soon` will try to make it one. A
                  common use case is if you're wrapping a function
                  before spawning a new task, you might pass the
                  original function as the ``name=`` to make
                  debugging easier.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: If this nursery is no longer open
                          (i.e. its ``async with`` block has
                          exited).
