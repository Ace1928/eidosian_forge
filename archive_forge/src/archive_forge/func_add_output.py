    Args:
      *args: The output tensor.
      **kwargs:
        "name" label
        "tag" a tag to group multiple arguments that will be aggregated. I.e.
          a string like 'cool_input'. Basically multiple inputs can be added
          to the same hint for parallel operations that will eventually be
          combined. An example would be static_rnn which creates multiple copies
          of state or inputs.
        "aggregate" aggregation strategy that is valid only for tag non None.
          Acceptable values are OpHint.AGGREGATE_FIRST, OpHint.AGGREGATE_LAST,
          and OpHint.AGGREGATE_STACK.
        "index_override" The global index to use. This corresponds to the
          argument order in the final stub that will be generated.
    Returns:
      The wrapped output tensor.
