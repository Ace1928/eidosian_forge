    """This computes a VTLN warping function that is not the same as HTK's one,
    but has similar inputs (this function has the advantage of never producing
    empty bins).

    This function computes a warp function F(freq), defined between low_freq
    and high_freq inclusive, with the following properties:
        F(low_freq) == low_freq
        F(high_freq) == high_freq
    The function is continuous and piecewise linear with two inflection
        points.
    The lower inflection point (measured in terms of the unwarped
        frequency) is at frequency l, determined as described below.
    The higher inflection point is at a frequency h, determined as
        described below.
    If l <= f <= h, then F(f) = f/vtln_warp_factor.
    If the higher inflection point (measured in terms of the unwarped
        frequency) is at h, then max(h, F(h)) == vtln_high_cutoff.
        Since (by the last point) F(h) == h/vtln_warp_factor, then
        max(h, h/vtln_warp_factor) == vtln_high_cutoff, so
        h = vtln_high_cutoff / max(1, 1/vtln_warp_factor).
          = vtln_high_cutoff * min(1, vtln_warp_factor).
    If the lower inflection point (measured in terms of the unwarped
        frequency) is at l, then min(l, F(l)) == vtln_low_cutoff
        This implies that l = vtln_low_cutoff / min(1, 1/vtln_warp_factor)
                            = vtln_low_cutoff * max(1, vtln_warp_factor)
