        Each time it's accessed, it updates the var_levels dictionary with the
        list of levels in the current semantic mappers. But it also allows the
        dictionary to persist, so it can be used to set levels by a key. This is
        used to track the list of col/row levels using an attached FacetGrid
        object, but it's kind of messy and ideally fixed by improving the
        faceting logic so it interfaces better with the modern approach to
        tracking plot variables.
