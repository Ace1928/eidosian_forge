Render the template to produce a native Python type. If the
        result is a single node, its value is returned. Otherwise, the
        nodes are concatenated as strings. If the result can be parsed
        with :func:`ast.literal_eval`, the parsed value is returned.
        Otherwise, the string is returned.
