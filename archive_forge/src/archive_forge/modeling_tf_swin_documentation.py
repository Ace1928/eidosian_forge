        labels (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*):
            Labels for computing the image classification/regression loss. Indices should be in `[0, ...,
            config.num_labels - 1]`. If `config.num_labels == 1` a regression loss is computed (Mean-Square loss), If
            `config.num_labels > 1` a classification loss is computed (Cross-Entropy).
