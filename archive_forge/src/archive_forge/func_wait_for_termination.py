def wait_for_termination(self, timeout=None):
    """Block current thread until the server stops.

        This is an EXPERIMENTAL API.

        The wait will not consume computational resources during blocking, and
        it will block until one of the two following conditions are met:

        1) The server is stopped or terminated;
        2) A timeout occurs if timeout is not `None`.

        The timeout argument works in the same way as `threading.Event.wait()`.
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Event.wait

        Args:
          timeout: A floating point number specifying a timeout for the
            operation in seconds.

        Returns:
          A bool indicates if the operation times out.
