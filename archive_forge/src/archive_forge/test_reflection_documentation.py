test that 'autoincrement' is reflected according to sqla's policy.

        Don't mark this test as unsupported for any backend !

        (technically it fails with MySQL InnoDB since "id" comes before "id2")

        A backend is better off not returning "autoincrement" at all,
        instead of potentially returning "False" for an auto-incrementing
        primary key column.
