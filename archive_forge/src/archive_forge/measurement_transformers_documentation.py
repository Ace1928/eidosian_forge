Initializes the qubit.

        Args:
            key: The key of the measurement gate being deferred.
            qid: One qubit that is being measured. Each deferred measurement
                should create one new _MeasurementQid per qubit being measured
                by that gate.
            index: For repeated measurement keys, this represents the index of that measurement.
