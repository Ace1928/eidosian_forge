    """Dead lettering is done on a best effort basis. The same message might be
  dead lettered multiple times. If validation on any of the fields fails at
  subscription creation/updation, the create/update subscription request will
  fail.

  Fields:
    deadLetterTopic: Optional. The name of the topic to which dead letter
      messages should be published. Format is
      `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.The Pub/Sub service account
      associated with the enclosing subscription's parent project (i.e.,
      service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must
      have permission to Publish() to this topic. The operation will fail if
      the topic does not exist. Users should ensure that there is a
      subscription attached to this topic since messages published to a topic
      with no subscriptions are lost.
    maxDeliveryAttempts: Optional. The maximum number of delivery attempts for
      any message. The value must be between 5 and 100. The number of delivery
      attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of NACKs and number of
      times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message). A
      NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
      client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines. This field will
      be honored on a best effort basis. If this parameter is 0, a default
      value of 5 is used.
