        Note that this counter is a class method reporting a class variable
        so the count is unique within a Python session. It could differ from
        session to session for a specific decorator depending on the order
        that the decorators are created. But that doesn't disrupt `argmap`.

        This is used in two places: to construct unique variable names
        in the `_name` method and to construct unique fictitious filenames
        in the `_compile` method.

        Returns
        -------
        count : int
            An integer unique to this Python session (simply counts from zero)
