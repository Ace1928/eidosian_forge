        start_positions (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*):
            Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
            Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
            are not taken into account for computing the loss.
        end_positions (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*):
            Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
            Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
            are not taken into account for computing the loss.
