Handler for the CMake set() function in all varieties.

        comes in three flavors:
        set(<var> <value> [PARENT_SCOPE])
        set(<var> <value> CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE])
        set(ENV{<var>} <value>)

        We don't support the ENV variant, and any uses of it will be ignored
        silently. the other two variates are supported, with some caveats:
        - we don't properly handle scoping, so calls to set() inside a
          function without PARENT_SCOPE set could incorrectly shadow the
          outer scope.
        - We don't honor the type of CACHE arguments
