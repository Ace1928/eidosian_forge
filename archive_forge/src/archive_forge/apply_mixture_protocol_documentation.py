Efficiently applies a mixture.

        This method is given both the target tensor and workspace of the same
        shape and dtype. The method then either performs inline modifications of
        the target tensor and returns it, or writes its output into the
        a workspace tensor and returns that. This signature makes it possible to
        write specialized simulation methods that run without performing large
        allocations, significantly increasing simulation performance.

        Args:
            args: A `cirq.ApplyMixtureArgs` object with the `args.target_tensor`
                to operate on, an `args.available_workspace` buffer to use as
                temporary workspace, and the `args.axes` of the tensor to target
                with the unitary operation. Note that this method is permitted
                (and in fact expected) to mutate `args.target_tensor` and
                `args.available_workspace`.

        Returns:
            If the receiving object is not able to apply its unitary effect,
            None or NotImplemented should be returned.

            If the receiving object is able to work inline, it should directly
            mutate `args.target_tensor` and then return `args.target_tensor`.
            The caller will understand this to mean that the result is in
            `args.target_tensor`.

            If the receiving object is unable to work inline, it can write its
            output over `args.available_buffer` and then return
            `args.available_buffer`. The caller will understand this to mean
            that the result is in `args.available_buffer` (and so what was
            `args.available_buffer` will become `args.target_tensor` in the next
            call, and vice versa).

            The receiving object is also permitted to allocate a new
            numpy.ndarray and return that as its result.
