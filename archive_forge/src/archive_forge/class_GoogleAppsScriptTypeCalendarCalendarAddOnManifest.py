  Fields:
    conferenceSolution: Defines conference solutions provided by this add-on.
    createSettingsUrlFunction: An endpoint to execute that creates a URL to
      the add-on's settings page.
    currentEventAccess: Defines the level of data access when an event add-on
      is triggered.
    eventOpenTrigger: An endpoint that triggers when an event is opened to be
      viewed or edited.
    eventUpdateTrigger: An endpoint that triggers when the open event is
      updated.
    homepageTrigger: Defines an endpoint that is executed in contexts that
      don't match a declared contextual trigger. Any cards generated by this
      function will always be available to the user, but might be eclipsed by
      contextual content when this add-on declares more targeted triggers. If
      present, this overrides the configuration from
      `addOns.common.homepageTrigger`.
