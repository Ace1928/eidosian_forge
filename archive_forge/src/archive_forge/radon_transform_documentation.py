Inverse radon transform.

    Reconstruct an image from the radon transform, using a single iteration of
    the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radon_image : ndarray, shape (M, N)
        Image containing radon transform (sinogram). Each column of
        the image corresponds to a projection along a different angle. The
        tomography rotation axis should lie at the pixel index
        ``radon_image.shape[0] // 2`` along the 0th dimension of
        ``radon_image``.
    theta : array, shape (N,), optional
        Reconstruction angles (in degrees). Default: m angles evenly spaced
        between 0 and 180 (if the shape of `radon_image` is (N, M)).
    image : ndarray, shape (M, M), optional
        Image containing an initial reconstruction estimate. Default is an array of zeros.
    projection_shifts : array, shape (N,), optional
        Shift the projections contained in ``radon_image`` (the sinogram) by
        this many pixels before reconstructing the image. The i'th value
        defines the shift of the i'th column of ``radon_image``.
    clip : length-2 sequence of floats, optional
        Force all values in the reconstructed tomogram to lie in the range
        ``[clip[0], clip[1]]``
    relaxation : float, optional
        Relaxation parameter for the update step. A higher value can
        improve the convergence rate, but one runs the risk of instabilities.
        Values close to or higher than 1 are not recommended.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Output data type, must be floating point. By default, if input
        data type is not float, input is cast to double, otherwise
        dtype is set to input data type.

    Returns
    -------
    reconstructed : ndarray
        Reconstructed image. The rotation axis will be located in the pixel
        with indices
        ``(reconstructed.shape[0] // 2, reconstructed.shape[1] // 2)``.

    Notes
    -----
    Algebraic Reconstruction Techniques are based on formulating the tomography
    reconstruction problem as a set of linear equations. Along each ray,
    the projected value is the sum of all the values of the cross section along
    the ray. A typical feature of SART (and a few other variants of algebraic
    techniques) is that it samples the cross section at equidistant points
    along the ray, using linear interpolation between the pixel values of the
    cross section. The resulting set of linear equations are then solved using
    a slightly modified Kaczmarz method.

    When using SART, a single iteration is usually sufficient to obtain a good
    reconstruction. Further iterations will tend to enhance high-frequency
    information, but will also often increase the noise.
