def dedensify(G, threshold, prefix=None, copy=True):
    """Compresses neighborhoods around high-degree nodes

    Reduces the number of edges to high-degree nodes by adding compressor nodes
    that summarize multiple edges of the same type to high-degree nodes (nodes
    with a degree greater than a given threshold).  Dedensification also has
    the added benefit of reducing the number of edges around high-degree nodes.
    The implementation currently supports graphs with a single edge type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G: graph
       A networkx graph
    threshold: int
       Minimum degree threshold of a node to be considered a high degree node.
       The threshold must be greater than or equal to 2.
    prefix: str or None, optional (default: None)
       An optional prefix for denoting compressor nodes
    copy: bool, optional (default: True)
       Indicates if dedensification should be done inplace

    Returns
    -------
    dedensified networkx graph : (graph, set)
        2-tuple of the dedensified graph and set of compressor nodes

    Notes
    -----
    According to the algorithm in [1]_, removes edges in a graph by
    compressing/decompressing the neighborhoods around high degree nodes by
    adding compressor nodes that summarize multiple edges of the same type
    to high-degree nodes.  Dedensification will only add a compressor node when
    doing so will reduce the total number of edges in the given graph. This
    implementation currently supports graphs with a single edge type.

    Examples
    --------
    Dedensification will only add compressor nodes when doing so would result
    in fewer edges::

        >>> original_graph = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> original_graph.add_nodes_from(
        ...     ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "A", "B", "C"]
        ... )
        >>> original_graph.add_edges_from(
        ...     [
        ...         ("1", "C"), ("1", "B"),
        ...         ("2", "C"), ("2", "B"), ("2", "A"),
        ...         ("3", "B"), ("3", "A"), ("3", "6"),
        ...         ("4", "C"), ("4", "B"), ("4", "A"),
        ...         ("5", "B"), ("5", "A"),
        ...         ("6", "5"),
        ...         ("A", "6")
        ...     ]
        ... )
        >>> c_graph, c_nodes = nx.dedensify(original_graph, threshold=2)
        >>> original_graph.number_of_edges()
        15
        >>> c_graph.number_of_edges()
        14

    A dedensified, directed graph can be "densified" to reconstruct the
    original graph::

        >>> original_graph = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> original_graph.add_nodes_from(
        ...     ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "A", "B", "C"]
        ... )
        >>> original_graph.add_edges_from(
        ...     [
        ...         ("1", "C"), ("1", "B"),
        ...         ("2", "C"), ("2", "B"), ("2", "A"),
        ...         ("3", "B"), ("3", "A"), ("3", "6"),
        ...         ("4", "C"), ("4", "B"), ("4", "A"),
        ...         ("5", "B"), ("5", "A"),
        ...         ("6", "5"),
        ...         ("A", "6")
        ...     ]
        ... )
        >>> c_graph, c_nodes = nx.dedensify(original_graph, threshold=2)
        >>> # re-densifies the compressed graph into the original graph
        >>> for c_node in c_nodes:
        ...     all_neighbors = set(nx.all_neighbors(c_graph, c_node))
        ...     out_neighbors = set(c_graph.neighbors(c_node))
        ...     for out_neighbor in out_neighbors:
        ...         c_graph.remove_edge(c_node, out_neighbor)
        ...     in_neighbors = all_neighbors - out_neighbors
        ...     for in_neighbor in in_neighbors:
        ...         c_graph.remove_edge(in_neighbor, c_node)
        ...         for out_neighbor in out_neighbors:
        ...             c_graph.add_edge(in_neighbor, out_neighbor)
        ...     c_graph.remove_node(c_node)
        ...
        >>> nx.is_isomorphic(original_graph, c_graph)
        True
