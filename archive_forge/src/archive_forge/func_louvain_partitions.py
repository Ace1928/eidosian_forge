    """Yields partitions for each level of the Louvain Community Detection Algorithm

    Louvain Community Detection Algorithm is a simple method to extract the community
    structure of a network. This is a heuristic method based on modularity optimization. [1]_

    The partitions at each level (step of the algorithm) form a dendrogram of communities.
    A dendrogram is a diagram representing a tree and each level represents
    a partition of the G graph. The top level contains the smallest communities
    and as you traverse to the bottom of the tree the communities get bigger
    and the overall modularity increases making the partition better.

    Each level is generated by executing the two phases of the Louvain Community
    Detection Algorithm.

    Be careful with self-loops in the input graph. These are treated as
    previously reduced communities -- as if the process had been started
    in the middle of the algorithm. Large self-loop edge weights thus
    represent strong communities and in practice may be hard to add
    other nodes to.  If your input graph edge weights for self-loops
    do not represent already reduced communities you may want to remove
    the self-loops before inputting that graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
    weight : string or None, optional (default="weight")
     The name of an edge attribute that holds the numerical value
     used as a weight. If None then each edge has weight 1.
    resolution : float, optional (default=1)
        If resolution is less than 1, the algorithm favors larger communities.
        Greater than 1 favors smaller communities
    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)
     Modularity gain threshold for each level. If the gain of modularity
     between 2 levels of the algorithm is less than the given threshold
     then the algorithm stops and returns the resulting communities.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
     Indicator of random number generation state.
     See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Yields
    ------
    list
        A list of sets (partition of `G`). Each set represents one community and contains
        all the nodes that constitute it.
