    """Google API Policy Annotation This message defines a simple API policy
  annotation that can be used to annotate API request and response message
  fields with applicable policies. One field may have multiple applicable
  policies that must all be satisfied before a request can be processed. This
  policy annotation is used to generate the overall policy that will be used
  for automatic runtime policy enforcement and documentation generation.

  Fields:
    resourcePermission: Specifies the required permission(s) for the resource
      referred to by the field. It requires the field contains a valid
      resource reference, and the request must pass the permission checks to
      proceed. For example, "resourcemanager.projects.get".
    resourceType: Specifies the resource type for the resource referred to by
      the field.
    selector: Selects one or more request or response message fields to apply
      this `FieldPolicy`. When a `FieldPolicy` is used in proto annotation,
      the selector must be left as empty. The service config generator will
      automatically fill the correct value. When a `FieldPolicy` is used in
      service config, the selector must be a comma-separated string with valid
      request or response field paths, such as "foo.bar" or "foo.bar,foo.baz".
