Overridable: return a readable & writable file.

        The file will be used as follows:
        - data is written to it
        - seek(0)
        - data is read from it

        The file is opened in binary mode for files, in text mode
        for other fields

        This version opens a temporary file for reading and writing,
        and immediately deletes (unlinks) it.  The trick (on Unix!) is
        that the file can still be used, but it can't be opened by
        another process, and it will automatically be deleted when it
        is closed or when the current process terminates.

        If you want a more permanent file, you derive a class which
        overrides this method.  If you want a visible temporary file
        that is nevertheless automatically deleted when the script
        terminates, try defining a __del__ method in a derived class
        which unlinks the temporary files you have created.
