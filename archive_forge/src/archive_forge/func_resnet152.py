    """ResNet-152 from `Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385>`__.

    .. note::
       The bottleneck of TorchVision places the stride for downsampling to the second 3x3
       convolution while the original paper places it to the first 1x1 convolution.
       This variant improves the accuracy and is known as `ResNet V1.5
       <https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/model-scripts/nvidia:resnet_50_v1_5_for_pytorch>`_.

    Args:
        weights (:class:`~torchvision.models.ResNet152_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights to use. See
            :class:`~torchvision.models.ResNet152_Weights` below for
            more details, and possible values. By default, no pre-trained
            weights are used.
        progress (bool, optional): If True, displays a progress bar of the
            download to stderr. Default is True.
        **kwargs: parameters passed to the ``torchvision.models.resnet.ResNet``
            base class. Please refer to the `source code
            <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py>`_
            for more details about this class.
