    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``"trainval"`` (default) or ``"test"``.
        target_types (string, sequence of strings, optional): Types of target to use. Can be ``category`` (default) or

                - ``category`` (int): Label for one of the 37 pet categories.
                - ``segmentation`` (PIL image): Segmentation trimap of the image.

            If empty, ``None`` will be returned as target.

        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in a PIL image and returns a transformed
            version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``.
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and puts it into
