        Initialize the statespace model with component matrices

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : array_like, optional
            Vector of constant values describing the mean of the stationary
            component of the initial state.
        Pstar : array_like, optional
            Stationary component of the initial state covariance matrix. If
            given, should be a matrix shaped `k_states x k_states`. The
            submatrix associated with the diffuse states should contain zeros.
            Note that by definition, `Pstar = R0 @ Q0 @ R0.T`, so either
            `R0,Q0` or `Pstar` may be given, but not both.
        Pinf : array_like, optional
            Diffuse component of the initial state covariance matrix. If given,
            should be a matrix shaped `k_states x k_states` with ones in the
            diagonal positions corresponding to states with diffuse
            initialization and zeros otherwise. Note that by definition,
            `Pinf = A @ A.T`, so either `A` or `Pinf` may be given, but not
            both.
        A : array_like, optional
            Diffuse selection matrix, used in the definition of the diffuse
            initial state covariance matrix. If given, should be a
            `k_states x k_diffuse_states` matrix that contains the subset of
            the columns of the identity matrix that correspond to states with
            diffuse initialization. Note that by definition, `Pinf = A @ A.T`,
            so either `A` or `Pinf` may be given, but not both.
        R0 : array_like, optional
            Stationary selection matrix, used in the definition of the
            stationary initial state covariance matrix. If given, should be a
            `k_states x k_nondiffuse_states` matrix that contains the subset of
            the columns of the identity matrix that correspond to states with a
            non-diffuse initialization. Note that by definition,
            `Pstar = R0 @ Q0 @ R0.T`, so either `R0,Q0` or `Pstar` may be
            given, but not both.
        Q0 : array_like, optional
            Covariance matrix associated with stationary initial states. If
            given, should be a matrix shaped
            `k_nondiffuse_states x k_nondiffuse_states`.
            Note that by definition, `Pstar = R0 @ Q0 @ R0.T`, so either
            `R0,Q0` or `Pstar` may be given, but not both.

        Notes
        -----
        The matrices `a, Pstar, Pinf, A, R0, Q0` and the process for
        initializing the state space model is as given in Chapter 5 of [1]_.
        For the definitions of these matrices, see equation (5.2) and the
        subsequent discussion there.
