        Args:
            images (list[Tensor]): images to be processed
            targets (list[Dict[str, Tensor]]): ground-truth boxes present in the image (optional)

        Returns:
            result (list[BoxList] or dict[Tensor]): the output from the model.
                During training, it returns a dict[Tensor] which contains the losses.
                During testing, it returns list[BoxList] contains additional fields
                like `scores`, `labels` and `mask` (for Mask R-CNN models).
