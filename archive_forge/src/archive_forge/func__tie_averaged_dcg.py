def _tie_averaged_dcg(y_true, y_score, discount_cumsum):
    """
    Compute DCG by averaging over possible permutations of ties.

    The gain (`y_true`) of an index falling inside a tied group (in the order
    induced by `y_score`) is replaced by the average gain within this group.
    The discounted gain for a tied group is then the average `y_true` within
    this group times the sum of discounts of the corresponding ranks.

    This amounts to averaging scores for all possible orderings of the tied
    groups.

    (note in the case of dcg@k the discount is 0 after index k)

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : ndarray
        The true relevance scores.

    y_score : ndarray
        Predicted scores.

    discount_cumsum : ndarray
        Precomputed cumulative sum of the discounts.

    Returns
    -------
    discounted_cumulative_gain : float
        The discounted cumulative gain.
