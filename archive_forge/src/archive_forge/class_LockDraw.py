    Some widgets, like the cursor, draw onto the canvas, and this is not
    desirable under all circumstances, like when the toolbar is in zoom-to-rect
    mode and drawing a rectangle.  To avoid this, a widget can acquire a
    canvas' lock with ``canvas.widgetlock(widget)`` before drawing on the
    canvas; this will prevent other widgets from doing so at the same time (if
    they also try to acquire the lock first).
