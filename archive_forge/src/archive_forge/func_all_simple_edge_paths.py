def all_simple_edge_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=None):
    """Generate lists of edges for all simple paths in G from source to target.

    A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : nodes
       Single node or iterable of nodes at which to end path

    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth to stop the search. Only paths of length <= cutoff are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    path_generator: generator
       A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths
       between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator
       produces no output.
       For multigraphs, the list of edges have elements of the form `(u,v,k)`.
       Where `k` corresponds to the edge key.

    Examples
    --------

    Print the simple path edges of a Graph::

        >>> g = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (2, 4), (1, 3), (3, 4)])
        >>> for path in sorted(nx.all_simple_edge_paths(g, 1, 4)):
        ...     print(path)
        [(1, 2), (2, 4)]
        [(1, 3), (3, 4)]

    Print the simple path edges of a MultiGraph. Returned edges come with
    their associated keys::

        >>> mg = nx.MultiGraph()
        >>> mg.add_edge(1, 2, key="k0")
        'k0'
        >>> mg.add_edge(1, 2, key="k1")
        'k1'
        >>> mg.add_edge(2, 3, key="k0")
        'k0'
        >>> for path in sorted(nx.all_simple_edge_paths(mg, 1, 3)):
        ...     print(path)
        [(1, 2, 'k0'), (2, 3, 'k0')]
        [(1, 2, 'k1'), (2, 3, 'k0')]


    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a modified depth-first search to generate the
    paths [1]_.  A single path can be found in $O(V+E)$ time but the
    number of simple paths in a graph can be very large, e.g. $O(n!)$ in
    the complete graph of order $n$.
