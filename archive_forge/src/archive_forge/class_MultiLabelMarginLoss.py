class MultiLabelMarginLoss(_Loss):
    """Creates a criterion that optimizes a multi-class multi-classification
    hinge loss (margin-based loss) between input :math:`x` (a 2D mini-batch `Tensor`)
    and output :math:`y` (which is a 2D `Tensor` of target class indices).
    For each sample in the mini-batch:

    .. math::
        \\text{loss}(x, y) = \\sum_{ij}\\frac{\\max(0, 1 - (x[y[j]] - x[i]))}{\\text{x.size}(0)}

    where :math:`x \\in \\left\\{0, \\; \\cdots , \\; \\text{x.size}(0) - 1\\right\\}`, \\
    :math:`y \\in \\left\\{0, \\; \\cdots , \\; \\text{y.size}(0) - 1\\right\\}`, \\
    :math:`0 \\leq y[j] \\leq \\text{x.size}(0)-1`, \\
    and :math:`i \\neq y[j]` for all :math:`i` and :math:`j`.

    :math:`y` and :math:`x` must have the same size.

    The criterion only considers a contiguous block of non-negative targets that
    starts at the front.

    This allows for different samples to have variable amounts of target classes.

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(C)` or :math:`(N, C)` where `N` is the batch size and `C`
          is the number of classes.
        - Target: :math:`(C)` or :math:`(N, C)`, label targets padded by -1 ensuring same shape as the input.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(N)`.

    Examples::

        >>> loss = nn.MultiLabelMarginLoss()
        >>> x = torch.FloatTensor([[0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8]])
        >>> # for target y, only consider labels 3 and 0, not after label -1
        >>> y = torch.LongTensor([[3, 0, -1, 1]])
        >>> # 0.25 * ((1-(0.1-0.2)) + (1-(0.1-0.4)) + (1-(0.8-0.2)) + (1-(0.8-0.4)))
        >>> loss(x, y)
        tensor(0.85...)
