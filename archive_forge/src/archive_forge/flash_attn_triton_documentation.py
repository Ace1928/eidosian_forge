        q: (batch_size, seqlen_q, nheads, headdim)
        k, v: (batch_size, seqlen_k, nheads, headdim)
        bias: optional, shape broadcastible to (batch, nheads, seqlen_q, seqlen_k).
            For example, ALiBi mask for causal would have shape (1, nheads, 1, seqlen_k).
            ALiBi mask for non-causal would have shape (1, nheads, seqlen_q, seqlen_k)
