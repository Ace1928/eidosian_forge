Notify waiters of the given object that it will be closed.

        Call this before closing a file descriptor (on Unix) or socket (on
        Windows). This will cause any `wait_readable` or `wait_writable`
        calls on the given object to immediately wake up and raise
        `~trio.ClosedResourceError`.

        This doesn't actually close the object – you still have to do that
        yourself afterwards. Also, you want to be careful to make sure no
        new tasks start waiting on the object in between when you call this
        and when it's actually closed. So to close something properly, you
        usually want to do these steps in order:

        1. Explicitly mark the object as closed, so that any new attempts
           to use it will abort before they start.
        2. Call `notify_closing` to wake up any already-existing users.
        3. Actually close the object.

        It's also possible to do them in a different order if that's more
        convenient, *but only if* you make sure not to have any checkpoints in
        between the steps. This way they all happen in a single atomic
        step, so other tasks won't be able to tell what order they happened
        in anyway.
