class FormalPowerSeriesCompose(FiniteFormalPowerSeries):
    """
    Represents the composed formal power series of two functions.

    Explanation
    ===========

    No computation is performed. Terms are calculated using a term by term logic,
    instead of a point by point logic.

    There are two differences between a :obj:`FormalPowerSeries` object and a
    :obj:`FormalPowerSeriesCompose` object. The first argument contains the outer
    function and the inner function involved in the omposition. Also, the
    coefficient sequence contains the generic sequence which is to be multiplied
    by a custom ``bell_seq`` finite sequence. The finite terms will then be added up to
    get the final terms.

        Returns the first `n` terms of the composed formal power series.
        Term by term logic is implemented here.

        Explanation
        ===========

        The coefficient sequence of the :obj:`FormalPowerSeriesCompose` object is the generic sequence.
        It is multiplied by ``bell_seq`` to get a sequence, whose terms are added up to get
        the final terms for the polynomial.

        >>> from sympy.abc import x
        >>> f1 = fps(exp(x))
        >>> f2 = fps(sin(x))
