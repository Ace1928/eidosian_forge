        Depending on the browser, stuff like ``e x p r e s s i o n(...)``
        can get interpreted, or ``expre/* stuff */ssion(...)``.  This
        checks for attempt to do stuff like this.

        Typically the response will be to kill the entire style; if you
        have just a bit of Javascript in the style another rule will catch
        that and remove only the Javascript from the style; this catches
        more sneaky attempts.
