import numpy as np
Compares the docstring output to the output gotten by running the code.

    Python addresses in the output are replaced with wildcards.

    Float values in the output compared as using `np.allclose`:

      * Float values are extracted from the text and replaced with wildcards.
      * The wildcard text is compared to the actual output.
      * The float values are compared using `np.allclose`.

    The method returns `True` if both the text comparison and the numeric
    comparison are successful.

    The numeric comparison will fail if either:

      * The wrong number of floats are found.
      * The float values are not within tolerence.

    Args:
      want: The output in the docstring.
      got: The output generated after running the snippet.
      optionflags: Flags passed to the doctest.

    Returns:
      A bool, indicating if the check was successful or not.
