def _pinv_solve(M, B, arbitrary_matrix=None):
    """Solve ``Ax = B`` using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.

    There may be zero, one, or infinite solutions.  If one solution
    exists, it will be returned.  If infinite solutions exist, one will
    be returned based on the value of arbitrary_matrix.  If no solutions
    exist, the least-squares solution is returned.

    Parameters
    ==========

    B : Matrix
        The right hand side of the equation to be solved for.  Must have
        the same number of rows as matrix A.
    arbitrary_matrix : Matrix
        If the system is underdetermined (e.g. A has more columns than
        rows), infinite solutions are possible, in terms of an arbitrary
        matrix.  This parameter may be set to a specific matrix to use
        for that purpose; if so, it must be the same shape as x, with as
        many rows as matrix A has columns, and as many columns as matrix
        B.  If left as None, an appropriate matrix containing dummy
        symbols in the form of ``wn_m`` will be used, with n and m being
        row and column position of each symbol.

    Returns
    =======

    x : Matrix
        The matrix that will satisfy ``Ax = B``.  Will have as many rows as
        matrix A has columns, and as many columns as matrix B.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> B = Matrix([7, 8])
    >>> A.pinv_solve(B)
    Matrix([
    [ _w0_0/6 - _w1_0/3 + _w2_0/6 - 55/18],
    [-_w0_0/3 + 2*_w1_0/3 - _w2_0/3 + 1/9],
    [ _w0_0/6 - _w1_0/3 + _w2_0/6 + 59/18]])
    >>> A.pinv_solve(B, arbitrary_matrix=Matrix([0, 0, 0]))
    Matrix([
    [-55/18],
    [   1/9],
    [ 59/18]])

    Notes
    =====

    This may return either exact solutions or least squares solutions.
    To determine which, check ``A * A.pinv() * B == B``.  It will be
    True if exact solutions exist, and False if only a least-squares
    solution exists.  Be aware that the left hand side of that equation
    may need to be simplified to correctly compare to the right hand
    side.
