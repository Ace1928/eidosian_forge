def triads_by_type(G):
    """Returns a list of all triads for each triad type in a directed graph.
    There are exactly 16 different types of triads possible. Suppose 1, 2, 3 are three
    nodes, they will be classified as a particular triad type if their connections
    are as follows:

    - 003: 1, 2, 3
    - 012: 1 -> 2, 3
    - 102: 1 <-> 2, 3
    - 021D: 1 <- 2 -> 3
    - 021U: 1 -> 2 <- 3
    - 021C: 1 -> 2 -> 3
    - 111D: 1 <-> 2 <- 3
    - 111U: 1 <-> 2 -> 3
    - 030T: 1 -> 2 -> 3, 1 -> 3
    - 030C: 1 <- 2 <- 3, 1 -> 3
    - 201: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3
    - 120D: 1 <- 2 -> 3, 1 <-> 3
    - 120U: 1 -> 2 <- 3, 1 <-> 3
    - 120C: 1 -> 2 -> 3, 1 <-> 3
    - 210: 1 -> 2 <-> 3, 1 <-> 3
    - 300: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3, 1 <-> 3

    Refer to the :doc:`example gallery </auto_examples/graph/plot_triad_types>`
    for visual examples of the triad types.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : digraph
       A NetworkX DiGraph

    Returns
    -------
    tri_by_type : dict
       Dictionary with triad types as keys and lists of triads as values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (5, 6), (5, 4), (6, 7)])
    >>> dict = nx.triads_by_type(G)
    >>> dict['120C'][0].edges()
    OutEdgeView([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1)])
    >>> dict['012'][0].edges()
    OutEdgeView([(1, 2)])
