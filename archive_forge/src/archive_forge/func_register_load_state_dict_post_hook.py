def register_load_state_dict_post_hook(self, hook):
    """Register a post hook to be run after module's ``load_state_dict`` is called.

        It should have the following signature::
            hook(module, incompatible_keys) -> None

        The ``module`` argument is the current module that this hook is registered
        on, and the ``incompatible_keys`` argument is a ``NamedTuple`` consisting
        of attributes ``missing_keys`` and ``unexpected_keys``. ``missing_keys``
        is a ``list`` of ``str`` containing the missing keys and
        ``unexpected_keys`` is a ``list`` of ``str`` containing the unexpected keys.

        The given incompatible_keys can be modified inplace if needed.

        Note that the checks performed when calling :func:`load_state_dict` with
        ``strict=True`` are affected by modifications the hook makes to
        ``missing_keys`` or ``unexpected_keys``, as expected. Additions to either
        set of keys will result in an error being thrown when ``strict=True``, and
        clearing out both missing and unexpected keys will avoid an error.

        Returns:
            :class:`torch.utils.hooks.RemovableHandle`:
                a handle that can be used to remove the added hook by calling
                ``handle.remove()``
