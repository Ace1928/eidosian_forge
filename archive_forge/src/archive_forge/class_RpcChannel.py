    """Abstract interface for an RPC channel.

  An RpcChannel represents a communication line to a service which can be used
  to call that service's methods.  The service may be running on another
  machine. Normally, you should not use an RpcChannel directly, but instead
  construct a stub {@link Service} wrapping it.  Example:

  Example:
    RpcChannel channel = rpcImpl.Channel("remotehost.example.com:1234")
    RpcController controller = rpcImpl.Controller()
    MyService service = MyService_Stub(channel)
    service.MyMethod(controller, request, callback)

    Call the given method of the remote service.  The signature of this
    procedure looks the same as Service.CallMethod(), but the requirements
    are less strict in one important way:  the request object doesn't have to
    be of any specific class as long as its descriptor is method.input_type.
