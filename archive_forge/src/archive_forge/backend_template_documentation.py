        Write out format foo.

        This method is normally called via `.Figure.savefig` and
        `.FigureCanvasBase.print_figure`, which take care of setting the figure
        facecolor, edgecolor, and dpi to the desired output values, and will
        restore them to the original values.  Therefore, `print_foo` does not
        need to handle these settings.
