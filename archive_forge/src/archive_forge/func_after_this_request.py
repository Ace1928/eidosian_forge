    """Executes a function after this request.  This is useful to modify
    response objects.  The function is passed the response object and has
    to return the same or a new one.

    Example::

        @app.route('/')
        def index():
            @after_this_request
            def add_header(response):

                return response
            return 'Hello World!'

    This is more useful if a function other than the view function wants to
    modify a response.  For instance think of a decorator that wants to add
    some headers without converting the return value into a response object.
