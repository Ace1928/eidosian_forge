    .. warning ::

        Do not instantiate an object of this class, all objects you'll ever need
        are already present in the libevdev namespace. Use :func:`evbit()`
        to get an :class:`EventCode` from numerical or string values.

    A class representing an evdev event code, e.g. libevdev.EV_ABS.ABS_X.
    To use a :class:`EventCode`, use the namespaced name directly::

        >>> print(libevdev.EV_ABS.ABS_X)
        ABS_X:0
        >>> print(libevdev.EV_ABS.ABS_Y)
        ABS_X:1
        >>> code = libevdev.EV_REL.REL_Y
        >>> print(code.type)
        EV_REL:2
        >>> int(code)
        1

    .. attribute:: value

        The numeric value of the event code. This value is also returned when
        the object is converted to ``int``.

    .. attribute:: name

        The string name of this event code. Where the name is not defined, a
        fake name is generated by this module, consisting of the prefix and
        the uppercase hexadecimal value, e.g. ``REL_0B``. These generated
        names (see :func:`EventCode.is_defined()`) should never be used as
        input.

        Note that even defined names are not a stable API. From time to time
        the kernel introduces a new name and aliases the old one. The same
        numeric event code may then return a different name than before.
        This does not affect the :func:`evbit()` function which continues to
        return the correct event code.

    .. attribute:: type

        The :class:`EventType` for this event code

    .. attribute:: is_defined

        ``True`` if this event bit has a ``#define`` in the kernel header.
        :class:`EventCode` objects not defined in the header have a name
        composed of the type name plus the hex code, e.g. ``KEY_2E8``.

        Usually you will not need to check this property unless you need to
        filter for known codes only.
