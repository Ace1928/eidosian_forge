Compute the Davies-Bouldin score.

    The score is defined as the average similarity measure of each cluster with
    its most similar cluster, where similarity is the ratio of within-cluster
    distances to between-cluster distances. Thus, clusters which are farther
    apart and less dispersed will result in a better score.

    The minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        A list of ``n_features``-dimensional data points. Each row corresponds
        to a single data point.

    labels : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted labels for each sample.

    Returns
    -------
    score: float
        The resulting Davies-Bouldin score.
