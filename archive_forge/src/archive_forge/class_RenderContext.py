    """
    A stack container for storing Template state.

    RenderContext simplifies the implementation of template Nodes by providing a
    safe place to store state between invocations of a node's `render` method.

    The RenderContext also provides scoping rules that are more sensible for
    'template local' variables. The render context stack is pushed before each
    template is rendered, creating a fresh scope with nothing in it. Name
    resolution fails if a variable is not found at the top of the RequestContext
    stack. Thus, variables are local to a specific template and don't affect the
    rendering of other templates as they would if they were stored in the normal
    template context.
