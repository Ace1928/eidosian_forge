def is_at_free(G):
    """Check if a graph is AT-free.

    The method uses the `find_asteroidal_triple` method to recognize
    an AT-free graph. If no asteroidal triple is found the graph is
    AT-free and True is returned. If at least one asteroidal triple is
    found the graph is not AT-free and False is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        The graph to check whether is AT-free or not.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if G is AT-free and False otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 5)])
    >>> nx.is_at_free(G)
    True

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(6)
    >>> nx.is_at_free(G)
    False
