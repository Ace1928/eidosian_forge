from torch.distributions import constraints, transforms

        Looks up a transform to constrained space, given a constraint object.
        Usage::

            constraint = Normal.arg_constraints['scale']
            scale = transform_to(constraint)(torch.zeros(1))  # constrained
            u = transform_to(constraint).inv(scale)           # unconstrained

        Args:
            constraint (:class:`~torch.distributions.constraints.Constraint`):
                A constraint object.

        Returns:
            A :class:`~torch.distributions.transforms.Transform` object.

        Raises:
            `NotImplementedError` if no transform has been registered.
