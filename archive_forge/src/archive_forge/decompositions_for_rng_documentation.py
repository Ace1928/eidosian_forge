    Singleton class to track the philox rng state during AOT Autograd tracing.
    For each aot tracing instance, AOT Autograd resets this tracker and keeps
    track of both forward and backward offsets. At runtime, we only care about
    the total consumed forward and backward offsets. For dynamic shapes, these
    offsets are a function of input shapes. Therefore, the AOT generated graphs
    have additional outputs that compute total consumed forward and backward
    offsets.
