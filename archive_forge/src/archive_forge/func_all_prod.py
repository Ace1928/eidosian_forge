  The computation is done with an all-reduce operation, so if only some of the

    tensors: The input tensors across which to multiply; must be assigned
      to GPU devices.

  Returns:
    List of tensors, each with the product of the input tensors, where tensor i
    has the same device as `tensors[i]`.
