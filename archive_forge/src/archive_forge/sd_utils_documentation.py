import enum

    Converts a state dict to new diffusers format. The state dict can be from previous diffusers format
    (`OLD_DIFFUSERS`), or PEFT format (`PEFT`) or new diffusers format (`DIFFUSERS`). In the last case the method will
    return the state dict as is.

    The method only supports the conversion from diffusers old, PEFT to diffusers new for now.

    Args:
        state_dict (`dict[str, torch.Tensor]`):
            The state dict to convert.
        original_type (`StateDictType`, *optional*):
            The original type of the state dict, if not provided, the method will try to infer it automatically.
        kwargs (`dict`, *args*):
            Additional arguments to pass to the method.

            - **adapter_name**: For example, in case of PEFT, some keys will be pre-pended
                with the adapter name, therefore needs a special handling. By default PEFT also takes care of that in
                `get_peft_model_state_dict` method:

                but we add it here in case we don't want to rely on that method.
