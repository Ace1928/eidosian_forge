    """
    Use Pollard's p-1 method to try to extract a nontrivial factor
    of ``n``. Either a divisor (perhaps composite) or ``None`` is returned.

    The value of ``a`` is the base that is used in the test gcd(a**M - 1, n).
    The default is 2.  If ``retries`` > 0 then if no factor is found after the
    first attempt, a new ``a`` will be generated randomly (using the ``seed``)
    and the process repeated.

    Note: the value of M is lcm(1..B) = reduce(ilcm, range(2, B + 1)).

    A search is made for factors next to even numbers having a power smoothness
    less than ``B``. Choosing a larger B increases the likelihood of finding a
    larger factor but takes longer. Whether a factor of n is found or not
    depends on ``a`` and the power smoothness of the even number just less than
    the factor p (hence the name p - 1).

    Although some discussion of what constitutes a good ``a`` some
    descriptions are hard to interpret. At the modular.math site referenced
    below it is stated that if gcd(a**M - 1, n) = N then a**M % q**r is 1
    for every prime power divisor of N. But consider the following:

        >>> from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import smoothness_p, pollard_pm1
        >>> n=257*1009
        >>> smoothness_p(n)
        (-1, [(257, (1, 2, 256)), (1009, (1, 7, 16))])

    So we should (and can) find a root with B=16:

        >>> pollard_pm1(n, B=16, a=3)
        1009

    If we attempt to increase B to 256 we find that it does not work:

        >>> pollard_pm1(n, B=256)
        >>>

    But if the value of ``a`` is changed we find that only multiples of
    257 work, e.g.:

        >>> pollard_pm1(n, B=256, a=257)
        1009

    Checking different ``a`` values shows that all the ones that did not
    work had a gcd value not equal to ``n`` but equal to one of the
    factors:

        >>> from sympy import ilcm, igcd, factorint, Pow
        >>> M = 1
        >>> for i in range(2, 256):
        ...     M = ilcm(M, i)
        ...
        >>> set([igcd(pow(a, M, n) - 1, n) for a in range(2, 256) if
        ...      igcd(pow(a, M, n) - 1, n) != n])
        {1009}

    But does aM % d for every divisor of n give 1?

        >>> aM = pow(255, M, n)
        >>> [(d, aM%Pow(*d.args)) for d in factorint(n, visual=True).args]
        [(257**1, 1), (1009**1, 1)]

    No, only one of them. So perhaps the principle is that a root will
    be found for a given value of B provided that:

    1) the power smoothness of the p - 1 value next to the root
       does not exceed B
    2) a**M % p != 1 for any of the divisors of n.

    By trying more than one ``a`` it is possible that one of them
    will yield a factor.

    Examples
    ========

    With the default smoothness bound, this number cannot be cracked:

        >>> from sympy.ntheory import pollard_pm1
        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571)

    Increasing the smoothness bound helps:

        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571, B=2000)
        4410317

    Looking at the smoothness of the factors of this number we find:

        >>> from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import smoothness_p, factorint
        >>> print(smoothness_p(21477639576571, visual=1))
        p**i=4410317**1 has p-1 B=1787, B-pow=1787
        p**i=4869863**1 has p-1 B=2434931, B-pow=2434931

    The B and B-pow are the same for the p - 1 factorizations of the divisors
    because those factorizations had a very large prime factor:

        >>> factorint(4410317 - 1)
        {2: 2, 617: 1, 1787: 1}
        >>> factorint(4869863-1)
        {2: 1, 2434931: 1}

    Note that until B reaches the B-pow value of 1787, the number is not cracked;

        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571, B=1786)
        >>> pollard_pm1(21477639576571, B=1787)
        4410317

    The B value has to do with the factors of the number next to the divisor,
    not the divisors themselves. A worst case scenario is that the number next
    to the factor p has a large prime divisisor or is a perfect power. If these
    conditions apply then the power-smoothness will be about p/2 or p. The more
    realistic is that there will be a large prime factor next to p requiring
    a B value on the order of p/2. Although primes may have been searched for
    up to this level, the p/2 is a factor of p - 1, something that we do not
    know. The modular.math reference below states that 15% of numbers in the
    range of 10**15 to 15**15 + 10**4 are 10**6 power smooth so a B of 10**6
    will fail 85% of the time in that range. From 10**8 to 10**8 + 10**3 the
    percentages are nearly reversed...but in that range the simple trial
    division is quite fast.
