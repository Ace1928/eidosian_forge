        Define the picking behavior of the artist.

        Parameters
        ----------
        picker : None or bool or float or callable
            This can be one of the following:

            - *None*: Picking is disabled for this artist (default).

            - A boolean: If *True* then picking will be enabled and the
              artist will fire a pick event if the mouse event is over
              the artist.

            - A float: If picker is a number it is interpreted as an
              epsilon tolerance in points and the artist will fire
              off an event if its data is within epsilon of the mouse
              event.  For some artists like lines and patch collections,
              the artist may provide additional data to the pick event
              that is generated, e.g., the indices of the data within
              epsilon of the pick event

            - A function: If picker is callable, it is a user supplied
              function which determines whether the artist is hit by the
              mouse event::

                hit, props = picker(artist, mouseevent)

              to determine the hit test.  if the mouse event is over the
              artist, return *hit=True* and props is a dictionary of
              properties you want added to the PickEvent attributes.
