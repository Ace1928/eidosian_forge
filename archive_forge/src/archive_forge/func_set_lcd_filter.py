    This function is used to apply color filtering to LCD decimated bitmaps,
    like the ones used when calling FT_Render_Glyph with FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD or
    FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V.

    **Note**

    This feature is always disabled by default. Clients must make an explicit
    call to this function with a 'filter' value other than FT_LCD_FILTER_NONE
    in order to enable it.

    Due to PATENTS covering subpixel rendering, this function doesn't do
    anything except returning 'FT_Err_Unimplemented_Feature' if the
    configuration macro FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING is not defined in
    your build of the library, which should correspond to all default builds of
    FreeType.

    The filter affects glyph bitmaps rendered through FT_Render_Glyph,
    FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap, FT_Load_Glyph, and FT_Load_Char.

    It does not affect the output of FT_Outline_Render and
    FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap.

    If this feature is activated, the dimensions of LCD glyph bitmaps are
    either larger or taller than the dimensions of the corresponding outline
    with regards to the pixel grid. For example, for FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD, the
    filter adds up to 3 pixels to the left, and up to 3 pixels to the right.

    The bitmap offset values are adjusted correctly, so clients shouldn't need
    to modify their layout and glyph positioning code when enabling the filter.
