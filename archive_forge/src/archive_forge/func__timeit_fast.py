    Returns the time the statement/function took, in seconds.

    Faster, less precise version of IPython's timeit. `stmt` can be a statement
    written as a string or a callable.

    Will do only 1 loop (like IPython's timeit) with no repetitions
    (unlike IPython) for very slow functions.  For fast functions, only does
    enough loops to take 5 ms, which seems to produce similar results (on
    Windows at least), and avoids doing an extraneous cycle that isn't
    measured.
