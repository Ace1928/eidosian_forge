    """
        Propagate the sharing attributes of a variable. If the privatization is
        determined by a parent scope, done propagate further.

        If we are a prange, we propagate our sharing attributes outwards to
        other pranges. If we are a prange in parallel block and the parallel
        block does not determine the variable private, we propagate to the
        parent of the parent. Recursion stops at parallel blocks, as they have
        no concept of lastprivate or reduction.

        So the following cases propagate:

            sum is a reduction for all loops:

                for i in prange(n):
                    for j in prange(n):
                        for k in prange(n):
                            sum += i * j * k

            sum is a reduction for both loops, local_var is private to the
            parallel with block:

                for i in prange(n):
                    with parallel:
                        local_var = ... # private to the parallel
                        for j in prange(n):
                            sum += i * j

        Nested with parallel blocks are disallowed, because they wouldn't
        allow you to propagate lastprivates or reductions:

            #pragma omp parallel for lastprivate(i)
            for i in prange(n):

                sum = 0

                #pragma omp parallel private(j, sum)
                with parallel:

                    #pragma omp parallel
                    with parallel:

                        #pragma omp for lastprivate(j) reduction(+:sum)
                        for j in prange(n):
                            sum += i

                    # sum and j are well-defined here

                # sum and j are undefined here

            # sum and j are undefined here
