    .. betastatus:: detection module

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape ``[C, H, W]``, one for each
    image, and should be in ``0-1`` range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending on if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors and targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:

        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the ground-truth boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (``Int64Tensor[N]``): the class label for each ground-truth box
        - masks (``UInt8Tensor[N, H, W]``): the segmentation binary masks for each instance

    The model returns a ``Dict[Tensor]`` during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the mask loss.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a ``List[Dict[Tensor]]``, one for each input image. The fields of the ``Dict`` are as
    follows, where ``N`` is the number of detected instances:

        - boxes (``FloatTensor[N, 4]``): the predicted boxes in ``[x1, y1, x2, y2]`` format, with
          ``0 <= x1 < x2 <= W`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2 <= H``.
        - labels (``Int64Tensor[N]``): the predicted labels for each instance
        - scores (``Tensor[N]``): the scores or each instance
        - masks (``UInt8Tensor[N, 1, H, W]``): the predicted masks for each instance, in ``0-1`` range. In order to
          obtain the final segmentation masks, the soft masks can be thresholded, generally
          with a value of 0.5 (``mask >= 0.5``)

    For more details on the output and on how to plot the masks, you may refer to :ref:`instance_seg_output`.

    Mask R-CNN is exportable to ONNX for a fixed batch size with inputs images of fixed size.

    Example::

        >>> model = torchvision.models.detection.maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn(weights=MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights.DEFAULT)
        >>> model.eval()
        >>> x = [torch.rand(3, 300, 400), torch.rand(3, 500, 400)]
        >>> predictions = model(x)
        >>>
        >>> # optionally, if you want to export the model to ONNX:
        >>> torch.onnx.export(model, x, "mask_rcnn.onnx", opset_version = 11)

    Args:
        weights (:class:`~torchvision.models.detection.MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights to use. See
            :class:`~torchvision.models.detection.MaskRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_Weights` below for
            more details, and possible values. By default, no pre-trained
            weights are used.
        progress (bool, optional): If True, displays a progress bar of the
            download to stderr. Default is True.
        num_classes (int, optional): number of output classes of the model (including the background)
        weights_backbone (:class:`~torchvision.models.ResNet50_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights for the backbone.
        trainable_backbone_layers (int, optional): number of trainable (not frozen) layers starting from
            final block. Valid values are between 0 and 5, with 5 meaning all backbone layers are
            trainable. If ``None`` is passed (the default) this value is set to 3.
        **kwargs: parameters passed to the ``torchvision.models.detection.mask_rcnn.MaskRCNN``
            base class. Please refer to the `source code
            <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/detection/mask_rcnn.py>`_
