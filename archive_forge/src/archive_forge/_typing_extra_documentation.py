Taken verbatim from python 3.10.8 unchanged, except:
        * type annotations of the function definition above.
        * prefixing `typing.` where appropriate
        * Use `_make_forward_ref` instead of `typing.ForwardRef` to handle the `is_class` argument.

        DO NOT CHANGE THIS METHOD UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.
        ======================================================

        Return type hints for an object.

        This is often the same as obj.__annotations__, but it handles
        forward references encoded as string literals, adds Optional[t] if a
        default value equal to None is set and recursively replaces all
        'Annotated[T, ...]' with 'T' (unless 'include_extras=True').

        The argument may be a module, class, method, or function. The annotations
        are returned as a dictionary. For classes, annotations include also
        inherited members.

        TypeError is raised if the argument is not of a type that can contain
        annotations, and an empty dictionary is returned if no annotations are
        present.

        BEWARE -- the behavior of globalns and localns is counterintuitive
        (unless you are familiar with how eval() and exec() work).  The
        search order is locals first, then globals.

        - If no dict arguments are passed, an attempt is made to use the
          globals from obj (or the respective module's globals for classes),
          and these are also used as the locals.  If the object does not appear
          to have globals, an empty dictionary is used.  For classes, the search
          order is globals first then locals.

        - If one dict argument is passed, it is used for both globals and
          locals.

        - If two dict arguments are passed, they specify globals and
          locals, respectively.
