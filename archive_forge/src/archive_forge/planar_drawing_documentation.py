Triangulate a face and make it 2-connected

    This method also adds all edges on the face to `edges_counted`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    embedding: nx.PlanarEmbedding
        The embedding that defines the faces
    starting_node : node
        A node on the face
    outgoing_node : node
        A node such that the half edge (starting_node, outgoing_node) belongs
        to the face
    edges_counted: set
        Set of all half-edges that belong to a face that have been visited

    Returns
    -------
    face_nodes: list
        A list of all nodes at the border of this face
