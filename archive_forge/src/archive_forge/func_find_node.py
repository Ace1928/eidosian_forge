def find_node(merged_nodes, node):
    """
        We can think of clusters of contracted nodes as having one
        representative in the graph. Each node which is not in merged_nodes
        is still its own representative. Since a representative can be later
        contracted, we need to recursively search though the dict to find
        the final representative, but once we know it we can use path
        compression to speed up the access of the representative for next time.

        This cannot be replaced by the standard NetworkX union_find since that
        data structure will merge nodes with less representing nodes into the
        one with more representing nodes but this function requires we merge
        them using the order that contract_edges contracts using.

        Parameters
        ----------
        merged_nodes : dict
            The dict storing the mapping from node to representative
        node
            The node whose representative we seek

        Returns
        -------
        The representative of the `node`
