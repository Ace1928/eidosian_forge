from tensorflow.python.framework import tensor_shape
Returns the shape of an unsharded Tensor given a list of shards.

    When given a list of shapes of shards, returns the shape of the
    unsharded Tensor that would generate the shards. Sets defaults for the
    policy if number_of_shards or shard_dimension is None.

    Args:
      shapes: The shapes of the Tensor shards to be combined.

    Returns:
      The shape of the unsharded version of the Tensor.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if shapes is not a list of length
        self.number_of_shards; or any element of shapes is not a valid
        shape consistent with the sharding policy; or the list of
        shapes is not a valid sharding of a full shape.
      TypeError: if an element of shapes is not convertible to a
        TensorShape
