def allow_mutation_on_saved_tensors():
    """Context manager under which mutating tensors saved for backward is allowed.

    Under this context manager, tensors saved for backward are cloned on mutation,
    so the original version can still be used during backward. Normally, mutating a tensor
    saved for backward will result in an error raised when it's used during backward.

    To ensure the correct behavior, both the forward and backward should be run under
    the same context manager.

    returns:
        An _AllowMutationOnSavedContext object storing the state managed by this
        context manager. This object can be useful for debugging purposes. The state
        managed by the context manager is automatically cleared upon exiting.

    Example::

        >>> import torch
        >>> with torch.autograd.graph.allow_mutation_on_saved_tensors():
        ...     # forward
        ...     a = torch.ones(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
        ...     b = a.clone()
        ...     out = (b**2).sum()
        ...     b.sin_()
        ...     # backward
        ...     out.sum().backward()
        ...
