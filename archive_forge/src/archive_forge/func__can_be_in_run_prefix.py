def _can_be_in_run_prefix(self, val: Any):
    """Determines what should be put in the prefix in `_run`

        The `_run` method has an optimization that reduces repetition by
        splitting the circuit into a prefix that is pure with respect to the
        state representation, and only executing that once per sample set. For
        state vectors, any unitary operation is pure, and we make this the
        default here. For density matrices, any non-measurement operation can
        be represented wholely in the matrix, and thus this method is
        overridden there to enable greater optimization there.

        Custom simulators can override this method appropriately.

        Args:
            val: An operation or noise model to test for purity within the
                state representation.

        Returns:
            A boolean representing whether the value can be added to the
            `_run` prefix."""
