Some or all of the layout text was reflowed.

            Text reflow is caused by document edits or changes to the layout's
            size.  Changes to the layout's position or active selection, and
            certain document edits such as text color, do not cause a reflow.

            Handle this event to update the position of a graphical element
            that depends on the laid out position of a glyph or line.
