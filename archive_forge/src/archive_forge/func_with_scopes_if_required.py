    This helper function is useful when you do not know (or care to know) the
    specific type of credentials you are using (such as when you use
    :func:`google.auth.default`). This function will call
    :meth:`Scoped.with_scopes` if the credentials are scoped credentials and if
    the credentials require scoping. Otherwise, it will return the credentials
    as-is.

    Args:
        credentials (google.auth.credentials.Credentials): The credentials to
            scope if necessary.
        scopes (Sequence[str]): The list of scopes to use.

    Returns:
        google.auth._credentials_async.Credentials: Either a new set of scoped
            credentials, or the passed in credentials instance if no scoping
            was required.
