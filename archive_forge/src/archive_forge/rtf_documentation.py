        Additional options accepted:

        ``fontface``
            Name of the font used. Could for example be ``'Courier New'``
            to further specify the default which is ``'\fmodern'``. The RTF
            specification claims that ``\fmodern`` are "Fixed-pitch serif
            and sans serif fonts". Hope every RTF implementation thinks
            the same about modern...
