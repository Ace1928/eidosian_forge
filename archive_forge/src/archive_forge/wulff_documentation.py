Create a cluster using the Wulff construction.

    A cluster is created with approximately the number of atoms
    specified, following the Wulff construction, i.e. minimizing the
    surface energy of the cluster.

    Parameters:

    symbol: The chemical symbol (or atomic number) of the desired element.

    surfaces: A list of surfaces. Each surface is an (h, k, l) tuple or
    list of integers.

    energies: A list of surface energies for the surfaces.

    size: The desired number of atoms.

    structure: The desired crystal structure.  One of the strings
    "fcc", "bcc", or "sc".

    rounding (optional): Specifies what should be done if no Wulff
    construction corresponds to exactly the requested number of atoms.
    Should be a string, either "above", "below" or "closest" (the
    default), meaning that the nearest cluster above or below - or the
    closest one - is created instead.

    latticeconstant (optional): The lattice constant.  If not given,
    extracted from ase.data.

    debug (optional): If non-zero, information about the iteration towards
    the right cluster size is printed.
