    Arguments:
        hidden_states: (total_nnz, ...), where total_nnz = number of tokens in selected in attention_mask.
        indices: (total_nnz), the indices that represent the non-masked tokens of the original padded input sequence.
        batch: int, batch size for the padded sequence.
        seqlen: int, maximum sequence length for the padded sequence.
    Return:
        hidden_states: (batch, seqlen, ...)
