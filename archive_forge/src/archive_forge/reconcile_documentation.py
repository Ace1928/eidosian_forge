Discard some packs from the repository.

        This removes them from the memory index, saves the in-memory index
        which makes the newly reconciled pack visible and hides the packs to be
        discarded, and finally renames the packs being discarded into the
        obsolete packs directory.

        :param packs: The packs to discard.
