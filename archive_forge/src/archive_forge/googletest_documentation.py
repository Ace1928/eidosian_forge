Reverses Set() calls, restoring things to their original definitions.

    This method is automatically called when the StubOutForTesting()
    object is deleted; there is no need to call it explicitly.

    It is okay to call UnsetAll() repeatedly, as later calls have no
    effect if no Set() calls have been made.
