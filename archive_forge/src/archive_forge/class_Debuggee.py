    """Represents the debugged application. The application may include one or
  more replicated processes executing the same code. Each of these processes
  is attached with a debugger agent, carrying out the debugging commands.
  Agents attached to the same debuggee identify themselves as such by using
  exactly the same Debuggee message value when registering.

  Enums:
    CanaryModeValueValuesEnum: Used when setting breakpoint canary for this
      debuggee.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: A set of custom debuggee properties, populated by the agent,
      to be displayed to the user.

  Fields:
    agentVersion: Version ID of the agent. Schema: `domain/language-
      platform/vmajor.minor` (for example `google.com/java-gcp/v1.1`).
    canaryMode: Used when setting breakpoint canary for this debuggee.
    description: Human readable description of the debuggee. Including a
      human-readable project name, environment name and version information is
      recommended.
    extSourceContexts: References to the locations and revisions of the source
      code used in the deployed application.
    id: Unique identifier for the debuggee generated by the controller
      service.
    isDisabled: If set to `true`, indicates that the agent should disable
      itself and detach from the debuggee.
    isInactive: If set to `true`, indicates that Controller service does not
      detect any activity from the debuggee agents and the application is
      possibly stopped.
    labels: A set of custom debuggee properties, populated by the agent, to be
      displayed to the user.
    project: Project the debuggee is associated with. Use project number or id
      when registering a Google Cloud Platform project.
    sourceContexts: References to the locations and revisions of the source
      code used in the deployed application.
    status: Human readable message to be displayed to the user about this
      debuggee. Absence of this field indicates no status. The message can be
      either informational or an error status.
    uniquifier: Uniquifier to further distinguish the application. It is
      possible that different applications might have identical values in the
      debuggee message, thus, incorrectly identified as a single application
      by the Controller service. This field adds salt to further distinguish
      the application. Agents should consider seeding this field with value
      that identifies the code, binary, configuration and environment.
