Send a command to the REPL, wait for and return output.

        :param str command: The command to send. Trailing newlines are not needed.
          This should be a complete block of input that will trigger execution;
          if a continuation prompt is found after sending input, :exc:`ValueError`
          will be raised.
        :param int timeout: How long to wait for the next prompt. -1 means the
          default from the :class:`pexpect.spawn` object (default 30 seconds).
          None means to wait indefinitely.
        :param bool async_: On Python 3.4, or Python 3.3 with asyncio
          installed, passing ``async_=True`` will make this return an
          :mod:`asyncio` Future, which you can yield from to get the same
          result that this method would normally give directly.
