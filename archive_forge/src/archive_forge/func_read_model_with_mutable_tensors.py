  Similar to read_model() with the addition that the returned object has
  mutable tensors (read_model() returns an object with immutable tensors).

  NOTE: This API only works for TFLite generated with
  _experimental_use_buffer_offset=false

  Args:
    input_tflite_file: Full path name to the input tflite file

  Raises:
    RuntimeError: If input_tflite_file path is invalid.
    IOError: If input_tflite_file cannot be opened.

  Returns:
    A mutable python object corresponding to the input tflite file.
