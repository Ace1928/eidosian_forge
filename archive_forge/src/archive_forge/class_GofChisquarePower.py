        Parameters
        ----------
        effect_size : float
            standardized effect size, according to Cohen's definition.
            see :func:`statsmodels.stats.gof.chisquare_effectsize`
        nobs : int or float
            sample size, number of observations.
        alpha : float in interval (0,1)
            significance level, e.g. 0.05, is the probability of a type I
            error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
        n_bins : int
            number of bins or cells in the distribution.

        Returns
        -------
        power : float
            Power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.

        Returns
        -------
        value : float
            The value of the parameter that was set to None in the call. The
            value solves the power equation given the remaining parameters.


        Notes
        -----
        The function uses scipy.optimize for finding the value that satisfies
        the power equation. It first uses ``brentq`` with a prior search for
        bounds. If this fails to find a root, ``fsolve`` is used. If ``fsolve``
        also fails, then, for ``alpha``, ``power`` and ``effect_size``,
        ``brentq`` with fixed bounds is used. However, there can still be cases
        where this fails.
