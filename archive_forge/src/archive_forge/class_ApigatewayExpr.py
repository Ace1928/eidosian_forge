    """Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL)
  syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL
  are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec. Example (Comparison):
  title: "Summary size limit" description: "Determines if a summary is less
  than 100 chars" expression: "document.summary.size() < 100" Example
  (Equality): title: "Requestor is owner" description: "Determines if
  requestor is the document owner" expression: "document.owner ==
  request.auth.claims.email" Example (Logic): title: "Public documents"
  description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
  expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"
  Example (Data Manipulation): title: "Notification string" description:
  "Create a notification string with a timestamp." expression: "'New message
  received at ' + string(document.create_time)" The exact variables and
  functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the
  service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional
  information.

  Fields:
    description: Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer
      text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
    expression: Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression
      Language syntax.
    location: Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for
      error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
    title: Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing
      its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the
      expression.
