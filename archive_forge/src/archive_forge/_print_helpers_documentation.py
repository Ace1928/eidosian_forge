        IPython/Jupyter LaTeX printing

        To change the behavior of this (e.g., pass in some settings to LaTeX),
        use init_printing(). init_printing() will also enable LaTeX printing
        for built in numeric types like ints and container types that contain
        SymPy objects, like lists and dictionaries of expressions.
