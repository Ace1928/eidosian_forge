    """An explanation method that redistributes Integrated Gradients
  attributions to segmented regions, taking advantage of the model's fully
  differentiable structure. Refer to this paper for more details:
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02825 Supported only by image Models.

  Fields:
    blurBaselineConfig: Config for XRAI with blur baseline. When enabled, a
      linear path from the maximally blurred image to the input image is
      created. Using a blurred baseline instead of zero (black image) is
      motivated by the BlurIG approach explained here:
      https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03383
    smoothGradConfig: Config for SmoothGrad approximation of gradients. When
      enabled, the gradients are approximated by averaging the gradients from
      noisy samples in the vicinity of the inputs. Adding noise can help
      improve the computed gradients. Refer to this paper for more details:
      https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf
    stepCount: Required. The number of steps for approximating the path
      integral. A good value to start is 50 and gradually increase until the
      sum to diff property is met within the desired error range. Valid range
      of its value is [1, 100], inclusively.
