    """Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time). This type can
  represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset is
  set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a particular
  offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is unset: a civil
  time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When neither time_zone
  nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day in local time. The
  date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar. If year, month, or day
  are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a specific year, month, or day
  respectively. This type may also be used to represent a physical time if all
  the date and time fields are set and either case of the `time_offset` oneof
  is set. Consider using `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If
  your use case also would like to store the user's timezone, that can be done
  in another field. This type is more flexible than some applications may
  want. Make sure to document and validate your application's limitations.

  Fields:
    day: Optional. Day of month. Must be from 1 to 31 and valid for the year
      and month, or 0 if specifying a datetime without a day.
    hours: Optional. Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23,
      defaults to 0 (midnight). An API may choose to allow the value
      "24:00:00" for scenarios like business closing time.
    minutes: Optional. Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59, defaults
      to 0.
    month: Optional. Month of year. Must be from 1 to 12, or 0 if specifying a
      datetime without a month.
    nanos: Optional. Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to
      999,999,999, defaults to 0.
    seconds: Optional. Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0
      to 59, defaults to 0. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-
      seconds.
    timeZone: Time zone.
    utcOffset: UTC offset. Must be whole seconds, between -18 hours and +18
      hours. For example, a UTC offset of -4:00 would be represented as {
      seconds: -14400 }.
    year: Optional. Year of date. Must be from 1 to 9999, or 0 if specifying a
      datetime without a year.
