Handle external entity reference in order to cache DTD locally.

        The purpose of this function is to load the DTD locally, instead
        of downloading it from the URL specified in the XML. Using the local
        DTD results in much faster parsing. If the DTD is not found locally,
        we try to download it. If new DTDs become available from NCBI,
        putting them in Bio/Entrez/DTDs will allow the parser to see them.
