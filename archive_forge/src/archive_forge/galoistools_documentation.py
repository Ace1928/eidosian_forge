    To solve f(x) congruent 0 mod(n).

    n is divided into canonical factors and f(x) cong 0 mod(p**e) will be
    solved for each factor. Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem to the
    results returns the final answers.

    Examples
    ========

    Solve [1, 1, 7] congruent 0 mod(189):

    >>> from sympy.polys.galoistools import gf_csolve
    >>> gf_csolve([1, 1, 7], 189)
    [13, 49, 76, 112, 139, 175]
