    """Represents a Cloud VPN Tunnel resource. For more information about VPN,
  read the the Cloud VPN Overview.

  Enums:
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the VPN tunnel, which
      can be one of the following: - PROVISIONING: Resource is being allocated
      for the VPN tunnel. - WAITING_FOR_FULL_CONFIG: Waiting to receive all
      VPN-related configs from the user. Network, TargetVpnGateway, VpnTunnel,
      ForwardingRule, and Route resources are needed to setup the VPN tunnel.
      - FIRST_HANDSHAKE: Successful first handshake with the peer VPN. -
      ESTABLISHED: Secure session is successfully established with the peer
      VPN. - NETWORK_ERROR: Deprecated, replaced by NO_INCOMING_PACKETS -
      AUTHORIZATION_ERROR: Auth error (for example, bad shared secret). -
      NEGOTIATION_FAILURE: Handshake failed. - DEPROVISIONING: Resources are
      being deallocated for the VPN tunnel. - FAILED: Tunnel creation has
      failed and the tunnel is not ready to be used. - NO_INCOMING_PACKETS: No
      incoming packets from peer. - REJECTED: Tunnel configuration was
      rejected, can be result of being denied access. - ALLOCATING_RESOURCES:
      Cloud VPN is in the process of allocating all required resources. -
      STOPPED: Tunnel is stopped due to its Forwarding Rules being deleted for
      Classic VPN tunnels or the project is in frozen state. -
      PEER_IDENTITY_MISMATCH: Peer identity does not match peer IP, probably
      behind NAT. - TS_NARROWING_NOT_ALLOWED: Traffic selector narrowing not
      allowed for an HA-VPN tunnel.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    detailedStatus: [Output Only] Detailed status message for the VPN tunnel.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ikeVersion: IKE protocol version to use when establishing the VPN tunnel
      with the peer VPN gateway. Acceptable IKE versions are 1 or 2. The
      default version is 2.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#vpnTunnel for VPN
      tunnels.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      VpnTunnel, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a VpnTunnel.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    localTrafficSelector: Local traffic selector to use when establishing the
      VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR
      formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges must be
      disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    peerExternalGateway: URL of the peer side external VPN gateway to which
      this VPN tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel
      is created. This field is exclusive with the field peerGcpGateway.
    peerExternalGatewayInterface: The interface ID of the external VPN gateway
      to which this VPN tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the
      VPN tunnel is created. Possible values are: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`. The
      number of IDs in use depends on the external VPN gateway redundancy
      type.
    peerGcpGateway: URL of the peer side HA VPN gateway to which this VPN
      tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel is
      created. This field can be used when creating highly available VPN from
      VPC network to VPC network, the field is exclusive with the field
      peerExternalGateway. If provided, the VPN tunnel will automatically use
      the same vpnGatewayInterface ID in the peer Google Cloud VPN gateway.
    peerIp: IP address of the peer VPN gateway. Only IPv4 is supported.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the VPN tunnel resides. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    remoteTrafficSelector: Remote traffic selectors to use when establishing
      the VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR
      formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges should be
      disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported.
    router: URL of the router resource to be used for dynamic routing.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sharedSecret: Shared secret used to set the secure session between the
      Cloud VPN gateway and the peer VPN gateway.
    sharedSecretHash: Hash of the shared secret.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the VPN tunnel, which can be one of
      the following: - PROVISIONING: Resource is being allocated for the VPN
      tunnel. - WAITING_FOR_FULL_CONFIG: Waiting to receive all VPN-related
      configs from the user. Network, TargetVpnGateway, VpnTunnel,
      ForwardingRule, and Route resources are needed to setup the VPN tunnel.
      - FIRST_HANDSHAKE: Successful first handshake with the peer VPN. -
      ESTABLISHED: Secure session is successfully established with the peer
      VPN. - NETWORK_ERROR: Deprecated, replaced by NO_INCOMING_PACKETS -
      AUTHORIZATION_ERROR: Auth error (for example, bad shared secret). -
      NEGOTIATION_FAILURE: Handshake failed. - DEPROVISIONING: Resources are
      being deallocated for the VPN tunnel. - FAILED: Tunnel creation has
      failed and the tunnel is not ready to be used. - NO_INCOMING_PACKETS: No
      incoming packets from peer. - REJECTED: Tunnel configuration was
      rejected, can be result of being denied access. - ALLOCATING_RESOURCES:
      Cloud VPN is in the process of allocating all required resources. -
      STOPPED: Tunnel is stopped due to its Forwarding Rules being deleted for
      Classic VPN tunnels or the project is in frozen state. -
      PEER_IDENTITY_MISMATCH: Peer identity does not match peer IP, probably
      behind NAT. - TS_NARROWING_NOT_ALLOWED: Traffic selector narrowing not
      allowed for an HA-VPN tunnel.
    targetVpnGateway: URL of the Target VPN gateway with which this VPN tunnel
      is associated. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel is created.
    vpnGateway: URL of the VPN gateway with which this VPN tunnel is
      associated. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel is created. This
      must be used (instead of target_vpn_gateway) if a High Availability VPN
      gateway resource is created.
    vpnGatewayInterface: The interface ID of the VPN gateway with which this
      VPN tunnel is associated. Possible values are: `0`, `1`.
