  Fields:

    cvssVersion: CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and severity.
    cwe: A list of CWE for this vulnerability. For details, see:
      https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html
    details: All information about the package to specifically identify this
      vulnerability. One entry per (version range and cpe_uri) the package
      vulnerability has manifested in.
    severity: Note provider assigned impact of the vulnerability.
    sourceUpdateTime: The time this information was last changed at the
      source. This is an upstream timestamp from the underlying information
      source - e.g. Ubuntu security tracker.
    windowsDetails: Windows details get their own format because the
      information format and model don't match a normal detail. Specifically
      Windows updates are done as patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really
      are a missing package, rather than a package being at an incorrect
      version.
