    API key authentication using a cookie.

    This defines the name of the cookie that should be provided in the request with
    the API key and integrates that into the OpenAPI documentation. It extracts
    the key value sent in the cookie automatically and provides it as the dependency
    result. But it doesn't define how to set that cookie.

    ## Usage

    Create an instance object and use that object as the dependency in `Depends()`.

    The dependency result will be a string containing the key value.

    ## Example

    ```python
    from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
    from fastapi.security import APIKeyCookie

    app = FastAPI()

    cookie_scheme = APIKeyCookie(name="session")


    @app.get("/items/")
    async def read_items(session: str = Depends(cookie_scheme)):
        return {"session": session}
    ```
