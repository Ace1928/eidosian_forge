def reconstruct_from_patches_2d(patches, image_size):
    """Reconstruct the image from all of its patches.

    Patches are assumed to overlap and the image is constructed by filling in
    the patches from left to right, top to bottom, averaging the overlapping
    regions.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <image_feature_extraction>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patches : ndarray of shape (n_patches, patch_height, patch_width) or         (n_patches, patch_height, patch_width, n_channels)
        The complete set of patches. If the patches contain colour information,
        channels are indexed along the last dimension: RGB patches would
        have `n_channels=3`.

    image_size : tuple of int (image_height, image_width) or         (image_height, image_width, n_channels)
        The size of the image that will be reconstructed.

    Returns
    -------
    image : ndarray of shape image_size
        The reconstructed image.
