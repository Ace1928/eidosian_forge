class FlaxCausalLMOutputWithCrossAttentions(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for causal language model (or autoregressive) outputs.

    Args:
        logits (`jnp.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`):
            Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).
        hidden_states (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
        cross_attentions (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Cross attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            cross-attention heads.
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(jnp.ndarray))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` tuples of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple containing the cached key, value
            states of the self-attention and the cross-attention layers if model is used in encoder-decoder setting.
            Only relevant if `config.is_decoder = True`.

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used (see
            `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
