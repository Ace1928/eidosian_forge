A point, with center at ``x`` and ``y``.

    Points map each record to a single bin.
    Points falling exactly on the upper bounds are treated as a special case,
    mapping into the previous bin rather than being cropped off.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : str
        Column names for the x and y coordinates of each point.
