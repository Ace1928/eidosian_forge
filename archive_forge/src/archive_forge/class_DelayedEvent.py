  Fields:
    cause: A textual description of the cause of the delay. The string can
      change without notice because it is often generated by another service
      (such as Compute Engine).
    metrics: If the delay was caused by a resource shortage, this field lists
      the Compute Engine metrics that are preventing this operation from
      running (for example, `CPUS` or `INSTANCES`). If the particular metric
      is not known, a single `UNKNOWN` metric will be present.
