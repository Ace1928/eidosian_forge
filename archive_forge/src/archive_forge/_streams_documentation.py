    Create a memory object stream.

    The stream's item type can be annotated like
    :func:`create_memory_object_stream[T_Item]`.

    :param max_buffer_size: number of items held in the buffer until ``send()`` starts
        blocking
    :param item_type: old way of marking the streams with the right generic type for
        static typing (does nothing on AnyIO 4)

        .. deprecated:: 4.0
          Use ``create_memory_object_stream[YourItemType](...)`` instead.
    :return: a tuple of (send stream, receive stream)
