def _AddDisableQuotaProject(parser):
    parser.add_argument('--disable-quota-project', default=False, action='store_true', help='      By default, the project in billing/quota_project or core/project will\n      be written to application default credentials (ADC) as the quota project.\n      When both are set, billing/quota_project takes precedence.\n      You can use --billing-project to overwrite the value in\n      billing/quota_project. Similarly, you can use --project to overwrite\n      the value in core/project. Client libraries will send it to services\n      and use it for quota and billing. To be able to use a project as the\n      quota project, the account in ADC must have the serviceusage.services.use\n      permission on the project. This permission is granted to the\n      project editor and project owner. You can create custom roles to\n      include this permission.\n\n      Note that some cloud services may ignore this quota project and still\n      bill the project owning the resources.\n\n      In the following situations, you may use this flag to skip setting the\n      quota project:\n\n        * The account in ADC cannot be granted the project editor or owner\n          role or any role with the serviceusage.services.use permission.\n        * You always want to bill the project owning the resources.\n      ')
