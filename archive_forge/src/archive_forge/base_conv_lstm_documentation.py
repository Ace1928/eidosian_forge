Abstract N-D Convolutional LSTM layer (used as implementation base).

    Similar to an LSTM layer, but the input transformations
    and recurrent transformations are both convolutional.

    Args:
      rank: Integer, rank of the convolution, e.g. "2" for 2D convolutions.
      filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space
        (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
      kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying the
        dimensions of the convolution window.
      strides: An integer or tuple/list of n integers,
        specifying the strides of the convolution.
        Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
        any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
      padding: One of `"valid"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive).
        `"valid"` means no padding. `"same"` results in padding evenly to
        the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same
        height/width dimension as the input.
      data_format: A string,
        one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
        The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
        `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
        `(batch, time, ..., channels)`
        while `channels_first` corresponds to
        inputs with shape `(batch, time, channels, ...)`.
        When unspecified, uses
        `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at
         `~/.keras/keras.json` (if exists) else 'channels_last'.
        Defaults to 'channels_last'.
      dilation_rate: An integer or tuple/list of n integers, specifying
        the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution.
        Currently, specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1 is
        incompatible with specifying any `strides` value != 1.
      activation: Activation function to use.
        By default hyperbolic tangent activation function is applied
        (`tanh(x)`).
      recurrent_activation: Activation function to use
        for the recurrent step.
      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix,
        used for the linear transformation of the inputs.
      recurrent_initializer: Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel`
        weights matrix,
        used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
      bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
      unit_forget_bias: Boolean.
        If True, add 1 to the bias of the forget gate at initialization.
        Use in combination with `bias_initializer="zeros"`.
        This is recommended in [Jozefowicz et al., 2015](
          http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf)
      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
        the `kernel` weights matrix.
      recurrent_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to
        the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.
      activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to.
      kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to
        the `kernel` weights matrix.
      recurrent_constraint: Constraint function applied to
        the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector.
      return_sequences: Boolean. Whether to return the last output
        in the output sequence, or the full sequence. (default False)
      return_state: Boolean Whether to return the last state
        in addition to the output. (default False)
      go_backwards: Boolean (default False).
        If True, process the input sequence backwards.
      stateful: Boolean (default False). If True, the last state
        for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial
        state for the sample of index i in the following batch.
      dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
        Fraction of the units to drop for
        the linear transformation of the inputs.
      recurrent_dropout: Float between 0 and 1.
        Fraction of the units to drop for
        the linear transformation of the recurrent state.
