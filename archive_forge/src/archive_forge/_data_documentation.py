        Returns indices of minimum elements along an axis.

        Implicit zero elements are taken into account. If there are several
        minimum values, the index of the first occurrence is returned. If
        ``NaN`` values occur in the matrix, the output defaults to a zero entry
        for the row/column in which the NaN occurs.

        Args:
            axis (int): {-2, -1, 0, 1, ``None``} (optional)
                Axis along which the argmin is computed. If ``None`` (default),
                index of the minimum element in the flatten data is returned.
            out (None): (optional)
                This argument is in the signature *solely* for NumPy
                compatibility reasons. Do not pass in anything except for
                the default value, as this argument is not used.

        Returns:
            (cupy.narray or int): Indices of minimum elements. If matrix,
            its size along ``axis`` is 1.
