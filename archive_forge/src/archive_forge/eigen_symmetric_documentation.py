    "svd" is a unified interface for "svd_r" and "svd_c". Depending on
    whether A is real or complex the appropriate function is called.

    This routine computes the singular value decomposition of a matrix A.
    Given A, two orthogonal (A real) or unitary (A complex) matrices U and V
    are calculated such that

           A = U S V        and        U' U = 1         and         V V' = 1

    where S is a suitable shaped matrix whose off-diagonal elements are zero.
    Here ' denotes the hermitian transpose (i.e. transposition and complex
    conjugation). The diagonal elements of S are the singular values of A,
    i.e. the squareroots of the eigenvalues of A' A or A A'.

    input:
      A             : a real or complex matrix of shape (m, n)
      full_matrices : if true, U and V are of shape (m, m) and (n, n).
                      if false, U and V are of shape (m, min(m, n)) and (min(m, n), n).
      compute_uv    : if true, U and V are calculated. if false, only S is calculated.
      overwrite_a   : if true, allows modification of A which may improve
                      performance. if false, A is not modified.

    output:
      U : an orthogonal or unitary matrix: U' U = 1. if full_matrices is true, U is of
          shape (m, m). ortherwise it is of shape (m, min(m, n)).

      S : an array of length min(m, n) containing the singular values of A sorted by
          decreasing magnitude.

      V : an orthogonal or unitary matrix: V V' = 1. if full_matrices is true, V is of
          shape (n, n). ortherwise it is of shape (min(m, n), n).

    return value:

           S          if compute_uv is false
       (U, S, V)      if compute_uv is true

    overview of the matrices:

      full_matrices true:
        A           : m*n
        U           : m*m     U' U  = 1
        S as matrix : m*n
        V           : n*n     V  V' = 1

     full_matrices false:
        A           : m*n
        U           : m*min(n,m)             U' U  = 1
        S as matrix : min(m,n)*min(m,n)
        V           : min(m,n)*n             V  V' = 1

    examples:

       >>> from mpmath import mp
       >>> A = mp.matrix([[2, -2, -1], [3, 4, -2], [-2, -2, 0]])
       >>> S = mp.svd(A, compute_uv = False)
       >>> print(S)
       [6.0]
       [3.0]
       [1.0]

       >>> U, S, V = mp.svd(A)
       >>> print(mp.chop(A - U * mp.diag(S) * V))
       [0.0  0.0  0.0]
       [0.0  0.0  0.0]
       [0.0  0.0  0.0]
