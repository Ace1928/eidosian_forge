class DimDynamic(Enum):
    """
    Controls how to perform symbol allocation for a dimension.  It is always
    sound to default this to DYNAMIC, but the policies DUCK and STATIC can
    result in better trace-time and compile-time performance, as they reduce
    the number of allocated symbols and generally make your graph more static.

    NB: If we notice you've applied a constraint to the dimension, we will
    force it to DYNAMIC for simplicity.

    DimDynamic is controlled by a variety of higher level UX features.
    Currently:

    - In eager mode, the default policy is DUCK.
        - The default is changed to STATIC with assume_static_by_default.
        - An individual dim is marked DYNAMIC if you mark_dynamic_dim.
    - In export mode, the default policy is STATIC.
        - An individual dim is marked DYNAMIC if you mention it as dynamic_dim
          in the constraints kwarg.
