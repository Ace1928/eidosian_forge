    """
    When applying transforms on a dataset, the data are stored in cache files.
    The caching mechanism allows to reload an existing cache file if it's already been computed.

    Reloading a dataset is possible since the cache files are named using the dataset fingerprint, which is updated
    after each transform.

    If disabled, the library will no longer reload cached datasets files when applying transforms to the datasets.
    More precisely, if the caching is disabled:
    - cache files are always recreated
    - cache files are written to a temporary directory that is deleted when session closes
    - cache files are named using a random hash instead of the dataset fingerprint
    - use [`~datasets.Dataset.save_to_disk`]] to save a transformed dataset or it will be deleted when session closes
    - caching doesn't affect [`~datasets.load_dataset`]. If you want to regenerate a dataset from scratch you should use
    the `download_mode` parameter in [`~datasets.load_dataset`].
