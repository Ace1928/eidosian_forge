A SessionManager used to manage sessions with lifecycles tied to those of a
    browser tab's websocket connection.

    WebsocketSessionManagers differentiate between "active" and "inactive" sessions.
    Active sessions are those with a currently active websocket connection. Inactive
    sessions are sessions without. Eventual cleanup of inactive sessions is a detail left
    to the specific SessionStorage that a WebsocketSessionManager is instantiated with.
