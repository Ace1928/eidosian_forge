def prun(self, parameter_s='', cell=None):
    """Run a statement through the python code profiler.

        Usage, in line mode:
          %prun [options] statement

        Usage, in cell mode:
          %%prun [options] [statement]
          code...
          code...

        In cell mode, the additional code lines are appended to the (possibly
        empty) statement in the first line.  Cell mode allows you to easily
        profile multiline blocks without having to put them in a separate
        function.

        The given statement (which doesn't require quote marks) is run via the
        python profiler in a manner similar to the profile.run() function.
        Namespaces are internally managed to work correctly; profile.run
        cannot be used in IPython because it makes certain assumptions about
        namespaces which do not hold under IPython.

        Options:

        -l <limit>
          you can place restrictions on what or how much of the
          profile gets printed. The limit value can be:

             * A string: only information for function names containing this string
               is printed.

             * An integer: only these many lines are printed.

             * A float (between 0 and 1): this fraction of the report is printed
               (for example, use a limit of 0.4 to see the topmost 40% only).

          You can combine several limits with repeated use of the option. For
          example, ``-l __init__ -l 5`` will print only the topmost 5 lines of
          information about class constructors.

        -r
          return the pstats.Stats object generated by the profiling. This
          object has all the information about the profile in it, and you can
          later use it for further analysis or in other functions.

        -s <key>
          sort profile by given key. You can provide more than one key
          by using the option several times: '-s key1 -s key2 -s key3...'. The
          default sorting key is 'time'.

          The following is copied verbatim from the profile documentation
          referenced below:

          When more than one key is provided, additional keys are used as
          secondary criteria when the there is equality in all keys selected
          before them.

          Abbreviations can be used for any key names, as long as the
          abbreviation is unambiguous.  The following are the keys currently
          defined:

          ============  =====================
          Valid Arg     Meaning
          ============  =====================
          "calls"       call count
          "cumulative"  cumulative time
          "file"        file name
          "module"      file name
          "pcalls"      primitive call count
          "line"        line number
          "name"        function name
          "nfl"         name/file/line
          "stdname"     standard name
          "time"        internal time
          ============  =====================

          Note that all sorts on statistics are in descending order (placing
          most time consuming items first), where as name, file, and line number
          searches are in ascending order (i.e., alphabetical). The subtle
          distinction between "nfl" and "stdname" is that the standard name is a
          sort of the name as printed, which means that the embedded line
          numbers get compared in an odd way.  For example, lines 3, 20, and 40
          would (if the file names were the same) appear in the string order
          "20" "3" and "40".  In contrast, "nfl" does a numeric compare of the
          line numbers.  In fact, sort_stats("nfl") is the same as
          sort_stats("name", "file", "line").

        -T <filename>
          save profile results as shown on screen to a text
          file. The profile is still shown on screen.

        -D <filename>
          save (via dump_stats) profile statistics to given
          filename. This data is in a format understood by the pstats module, and
          is generated by a call to the dump_stats() method of profile
          objects. The profile is still shown on screen.

        -q
          suppress output to the pager.  Best used with -T and/or -D above.

        If you want to run complete programs under the profiler's control, use
        ``%run -p [prof_opts] filename.py [args to program]`` where prof_opts
        contains profiler specific options as described here.
