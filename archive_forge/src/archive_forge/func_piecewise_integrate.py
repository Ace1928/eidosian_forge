def piecewise_integrate(self, x, **kwargs):
    """Return the Piecewise with each expression being
        replaced with its antiderivative. To obtain a continuous
        antiderivative, use the :func:`~.integrate` function or method.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import Piecewise
        >>> from sympy.abc import x
        >>> p = Piecewise((0, x < 0), (1, x < 1), (2, True))
        >>> p.piecewise_integrate(x)
        Piecewise((0, x < 0), (x, x < 1), (2*x, True))

        Note that this does not give a continuous function, e.g.
        at x = 1 the 3rd condition applies and the antiderivative
        there is 2*x so the value of the antiderivative is 2:

        >>> anti = _
        >>> anti.subs(x, 1)
        2

        The continuous derivative accounts for the integral *up to*
        the point of interest, however:

        >>> p.integrate(x)
        Piecewise((0, x < 0), (x, x < 1), (2*x - 1, True))
        >>> _.subs(x, 1)
        1
