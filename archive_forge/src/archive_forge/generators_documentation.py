Returns a random bipartite graph G_{n,m,k}.

    Produces a bipartite graph chosen randomly out of the set of all graphs
    with n top nodes, m bottom nodes, and k edges.
    The graph is composed of two sets of nodes.
    Set A has nodes 0 to (n - 1) and set B has nodes n to (n + m - 1).

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes in the first bipartite set.
    m : int
        The number of nodes in the second bipartite set.
    k : int
        The number of edges
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    directed : bool, optional (default=False)
        If True return a directed graph

    Examples
    --------
    from nx.algorithms import bipartite
    G = bipartite.gnmk_random_graph(10,20,50)

    --------
    gnm_random_graph

    Notes
    -----
    If k > m * n then a complete bipartite graph is returned.

    This graph is a bipartite version of the `G_{nm}` random graph model.

    The nodes are assigned the attribute 'bipartite' with the value 0 or 1
    to indicate which bipartite set the node belongs to.

    This function is not imported in the main namespace.
    To use it use nx.bipartite.gnmk_random_graph
