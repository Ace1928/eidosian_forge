For more information about these settings you can read the settings
documentation in docs/topics/settings.rst

Scrapy developers, if you add a setting here remember to:

* add it in alphabetical order
* group similar settings without leaving blank lines
* add its documentation to the available settings documentation
  (docs/topics/settings.rst)
