def has_bridges(G, root=None):
    """Decide whether a graph has any bridges.

    A *bridge* in a graph is an edge whose removal causes the number of
    connected components of the graph to increase.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph

    root : node (optional)
       A node in the graph `G`. If specified, only the bridges in the
       connected component containing this node will be considered.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
       Whether the graph (or the connected component containing `root`)
       has any bridges.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
       If `root` is not in the graph `G`.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is a directed graph.

    Examples
    --------
    The barbell graph with parameter zero has a single bridge::

        >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(10, 0)
        >>> nx.has_bridges(G)
        True

    On the other hand, the cycle graph has no bridges::

        >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(5)
        >>> nx.has_bridges(G)
        False

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation uses the :func:`networkx.bridges` function, so
    it shares its worst-case time complexity, $O(m + n)$, ignoring
    polylogarithmic factors, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the
    graph and $m$ is the number of edges.
