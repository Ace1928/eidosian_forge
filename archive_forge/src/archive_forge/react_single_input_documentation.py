Parses ReAct-style LLM calls that have a single tool input.

    Expects output to be in one of two formats.

    If the output signals that an action should be taken,
    should be in the below format. This will result in an AgentAction
    being returned.

    ```
    Thought: agent thought here
    Action: search
    Action Input: what is the temperature in SF?
    ```

    If the output signals that a final answer should be given,
    should be in the below format. This will result in an AgentFinish
    being returned.

    ```
    Thought: agent thought here
    Final Answer: The temperature is 100 degrees
    ```
