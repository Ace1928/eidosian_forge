    """A build resource in the Cloud Build API. At a high level, a `Build`
  describes where to find source code, how to build it (for example, the
  builder image to run on the source), and where to store the built artifacts.
  Fields can include the following variables, which will be expanded when the
  build is created: - $PROJECT_ID: the project ID of the build. -
  $PROJECT_NUMBER: the project number of the build. - $LOCATION: the
  location/region of the build. - $BUILD_ID: the autogenerated ID of the
  build. - $REPO_NAME: the source repository name specified by RepoSource. -
  $BRANCH_NAME: the branch name specified by RepoSource. - $TAG_NAME: the tag
  name specified by RepoSource. - $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA: the commit SHA
  specified by RepoSource or resolved from the specified branch or tag. -
  $SHORT_SHA: first 7 characters of $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA.

  Enums:
    StatusValueValuesEnum: Output only. Status of the build.

  Messages:
    SubstitutionsValue: Substitutions data for `Build` resource.
    TimingValue: Output only. Stores timing information for phases of the
      build. Valid keys are: * BUILD: time to execute all build steps. * PUSH:
      time to push all artifacts including docker images and non docker
      artifacts. * FETCHSOURCE: time to fetch source. * SETUPBUILD: time to
      set up build. If the build does not specify source or images, these keys
      will not be included.

  Fields:
    approval: Output only. Describes this build's approval configuration,
      status, and result.
    artifacts: Artifacts produced by the build that should be uploaded upon
      successful completion of all build steps.
    availableSecrets: Secrets and secret environment variables.
    buildTriggerId: Output only. The ID of the `BuildTrigger` that triggered
      this build, if it was triggered automatically.
    createTime: Output only. Time at which the request to create the build was
      received.
    failureInfo: Output only. Contains information about the build when
      status=FAILURE.
    finishTime: Output only. Time at which execution of the build was
      finished. The difference between finish_time and start_time is the
      duration of the build's execution.
    id: Output only. Unique identifier of the build.
    images: A list of images to be pushed upon the successful completion of
      all build steps. The images are pushed using the builder service
      account's credentials. The digests of the pushed images will be stored
      in the `Build` resource's results field. If any of the images fail to be
      pushed, the build status is marked `FAILURE`.
    logUrl: Output only. URL to logs for this build in Google Cloud Console.
    logsBucket: Cloud Storage bucket where logs should be written (see [Bucket
      Name Requirements](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-
      naming#requirements)). Logs file names will be of the format
      `${logs_bucket}/log-${build_id}.txt`.
    name: Output only. The 'Build' name with format:
      `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/builds/{build}`, where {build}
      is a unique identifier generated by the service.
    options: Special options for this build.
    projectId: Output only. ID of the project.
    queueTtl: TTL in queue for this build. If provided and the build is
      enqueued longer than this value, the build will expire and the build
      status will be `EXPIRED`. The TTL starts ticking from create_time.
    results: Output only. Results of the build.
    secrets: Secrets to decrypt using Cloud Key Management Service. Note:
      Secret Manager is the recommended technique for managing sensitive data
      with Cloud Build. Use `available_secrets` to configure builds to access
      secrets from Secret Manager. For instructions, see:
      https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/securing-builds/use-secrets
    serviceAccount: IAM service account whose credentials will be used at
      build runtime. Must be of the format
      `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAccounts/{ACCOUNT}`. ACCOUNT can be email
      address or uniqueId of the service account.
    source: The location of the source files to build.
    sourceProvenance: Output only. A permanent fixed identifier for source.
    startTime: Output only. Time at which execution of the build was started.
    status: Output only. Status of the build.
    statusDetail: Output only. Customer-readable message about the current
      status.
    steps: Required. The operations to be performed on the workspace.
    substitutions: Substitutions data for `Build` resource.
    tags: Tags for annotation of a `Build`. These are not docker tags.
    timeout: Amount of time that this build should be allowed to run, to
      second granularity. If this amount of time elapses, work on the build
      will cease and the build status will be `TIMEOUT`. `timeout` starts
      ticking from `startTime`. Default time is 60 minutes.
    timing: Output only. Stores timing information for phases of the build.
      Valid keys are: * BUILD: time to execute all build steps. * PUSH: time
      to push all artifacts including docker images and non docker artifacts.
      * FETCHSOURCE: time to fetch source. * SETUPBUILD: time to set up build.
      If the build does not specify source or images, these keys will not be
      included.
    warnings: Output only. Non-fatal problems encountered during the execution
      of the build.
