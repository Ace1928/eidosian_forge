    A selector supports registering file objects to be monitored for specific
    I/O events.

    A file object is a file descriptor or any object with a `fileno()` method.
    An arbitrary object can be attached to the file object, which can be used
    for example to store context information, a callback, etc.

    A selector can use various implementations (select(), poll(), epoll()...)
    depending on the platform. The default `Selector` class uses the most
    efficient implementation on the current platform.
