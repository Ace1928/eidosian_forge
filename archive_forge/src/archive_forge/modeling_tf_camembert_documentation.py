        encoder_hidden_states  (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
            the model is configured as a decoder.
        encoder_attention_mask (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
            the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

        past_key_values (`Tuple[Tuple[tf.Tensor]]` of length `config.n_layers`)
            contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.
            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`). Set to `False` during training, `True` during generation
        labels (`tf.Tensor` or `np.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Labels for computing the cross entropy classification loss. Indices should be in `[0, ...,
            config.vocab_size - 1]`.
