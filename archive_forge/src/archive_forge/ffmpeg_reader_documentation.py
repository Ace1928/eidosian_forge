 Read a file video frame at time t.

        Note for coders: getting an arbitrary frame in the video with
        ffmpeg can be painfully slow if some decoding has to be done.
        This function tries to avoid fetching arbitrary frames
        whenever possible, by moving between adjacent frames.
