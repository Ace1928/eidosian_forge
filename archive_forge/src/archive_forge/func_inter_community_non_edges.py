    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph.

    partition : iterable of sets of nodes
        This must be a partition of the nodes of `G`.

    A *non-edge* is a pair of nodes (undirected if `G` is undirected)
    that are not adjacent in `G`. The *inter-community non-edges* are
    those non-edges on a pair of nodes in different blocks of the
    partition.

    Implementation note: this function creates two intermediate graphs,
    which may require up to twice the amount of memory as required to
    store `G`.
