    """Generate edges in a maximum spanning forest of an undirected
    weighted graph.

    A maximum spanning tree is a subgraph of the graph (a tree)
    with the maximum possible sum of edge weights.  A spanning forest is a
    union of the spanning trees for each connected component of the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected Graph
       An undirected graph. If `G` is connected, then the algorithm finds a
       spanning tree. Otherwise, a spanning forest is found.

    algorithm : string
       The algorithm to use when finding a maximum spanning tree. Valid
       choices are 'kruskal', 'prim', or 'boruvka'. The default is 'kruskal'.

    weight : string
       Edge data key to use for weight (default 'weight').

    keys : bool
       Whether to yield edge key in multigraphs in addition to the edge.
       If `G` is not a multigraph, this is ignored.

    data : bool, optional
       If True yield the edge data along with the edge.

    ignore_nan : bool (default: False)
        If a NaN is found as an edge weight normally an exception is raised.
        If `ignore_nan is True` then that edge is ignored instead.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : iterator
       An iterator over edges in a maximum spanning tree of `G`.
       Edges connecting nodes `u` and `v` are represented as tuples:
       `(u, v, k, d)` or `(u, v, k)` or `(u, v, d)` or `(u, v)`

       If `G` is a multigraph, `keys` indicates whether the edge key `k` will
       be reported in the third position in the edge tuple. `data` indicates
       whether the edge datadict `d` will appear at the end of the edge tuple.

       If `G` is not a multigraph, the tuples are `(u, v, d)` if `data` is True
       or `(u, v)` if `data` is False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import tree

    Find maximum spanning edges by Kruskal's algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)
    >>> mst = tree.maximum_spanning_edges(G, algorithm="kruskal", data=False)
    >>> edgelist = list(mst)
    >>> sorted(sorted(e) for e in edgelist)
    [[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 2]]

    Find maximum spanning edges by Prim's algorithm

    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, weight=2)  # assign weight 2 to edge 0-3
    >>> mst = tree.maximum_spanning_edges(G, algorithm="prim", data=False)
    >>> edgelist = list(mst)
    >>> sorted(sorted(e) for e in edgelist)
    [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3]]

    Notes
    -----
    For Borůvka's algorithm, each edge must have a weight attribute, and
    each edge weight must be distinct.

    For the other algorithms, if the graph edges do not have a weight
    attribute a default weight of 1 will be used.
