def _set_partitions(n):
    """Cycle through all partitions of n elements, yielding the
    current number of partitions, ``m``, and a mutable list, ``q``

    between function calls.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import _set_partitions, _partition
    >>> for m, q in _set_partitions(3):
    ...     print('%s %s %s' % (m, q, _partition('abc', q, m)))
    1 [0, 0, 0] [['a', 'b', 'c']]
    2 [0, 0, 1] [['a', 'b'], ['c']]
    2 [0, 1, 0] [['a', 'c'], ['b']]
    2 [0, 1, 1] [['a'], ['b', 'c']]
    3 [0, 1, 2] [['a'], ['b'], ['c']]

    Notes
    =====

    This algorithm is similar to, and solves the same problem as,
    Algorithm 7.2.1.5H, from volume 4A of Knuth's The Art of Computer
    Programming.  Knuth uses the term "restricted growth string" where
    this code refers to a "partition vector". In each case, the meaning is
    the same: the value in the ith element of the vector specifies to
    which part the ith set element is to be assigned.

    At the lowest level, this code implements an n-digit big-endian
    counter (stored in the array q) which is incremented (with carries) to
    get the next partition in the sequence.  A special twist is that a
    digit is constrained to be at most one greater than the maximum of all
    the digits to the left of it.  The array p maintains this maximum, so
    that the code can efficiently decide when a digit can be incremented
    in place or whether it needs to be reset to 0 and trigger a carry to
    the next digit.  The enumeration starts with all the digits 0 (which
    corresponds to all the set elements being assigned to the same 0th
    part), and ends with 0123...n, which corresponds to each set element
    being assigned to a different, singleton, part.

    This routine was rewritten to use 0-based lists while trying to
    preserve the beauty and efficiency of the original algorithm.
