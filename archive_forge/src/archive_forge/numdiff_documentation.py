Calculate Hessian with complex-step derivative approximation

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
       value at which function derivative is evaluated
    f : function
       function of one array f(x)
    epsilon : float
       stepsize, if None, then stepsize is automatically chosen

    Returns
    -------
    hess : ndarray
       array of partial second derivatives, Hessian

    Notes
    -----
    based on equation 10 in
    M. S. RIDOUT: Statistical Applications of the Complex-step Method
    of Numerical Differentiation, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, U.K.

    The stepsize is the same for the complex and the finite difference part.
