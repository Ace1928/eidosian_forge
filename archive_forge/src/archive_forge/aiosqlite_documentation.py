.. dialect:: sqlite+aiosqlite
    :name: aiosqlite
    :dbapi: aiosqlite
    :connectstring: sqlite+aiosqlite:///file_path
    :url: https://pypi.org/project/aiosqlite/

The aiosqlite dialect provides support for the SQLAlchemy asyncio interface
running on top of pysqlite.

aiosqlite is a wrapper around pysqlite that uses a background thread for
each connection.   It does not actually use non-blocking IO, as SQLite
databases are not socket-based.  However it does provide a working asyncio
interface that's useful for testing and prototyping purposes.

Using a special asyncio mediation layer, the aiosqlite dialect is usable
as the backend for the :ref:`SQLAlchemy asyncio <asyncio_toplevel>`
extension package.

This dialect should normally be used only with the
:func:`_asyncio.create_async_engine` engine creation function::

    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine
    engine = create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///filename")

The URL passes through all arguments to the ``pysqlite`` driver, so all
connection arguments are the same as they are for that of :ref:`pysqlite`.

.. _aiosqlite_udfs:

User-Defined Functions
----------------------

aiosqlite extends pysqlite to support async, so we can create our own user-defined functions (UDFs)
in Python and use them directly in SQLite queries as described here: :ref:`pysqlite_udfs`.

.. _aiosqlite_serializable:

Serializable isolation / Savepoints / Transactional DDL (asyncio version)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly to pysqlite, aiosqlite does not support SAVEPOINT feature.

The solution is similar to :ref:`pysqlite_serializable`. This is achieved by the event listeners in async::

    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, event
    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine

    engine = create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///myfile.db")

    @event.listens_for(engine.sync_engine, "connect")
    def do_connect(dbapi_connection, connection_record):
        # disable aiosqlite's emitting of the BEGIN statement entirely.
        # also stops it from emitting COMMIT before any DDL.
        dbapi_connection.isolation_level = None

    @event.listens_for(engine.sync_engine, "begin")
    def do_begin(conn):
        # emit our own BEGIN
        conn.exec_driver_sql("BEGIN")

.. warning:: When using the above recipe, it is advised to not use the
   :paramref:`.Connection.execution_options.isolation_level` setting on
   :class:`_engine.Connection` and :func:`_sa.create_engine`
   with the SQLite driver,
   as this function necessarily will also alter the ".isolation_level" setting.
