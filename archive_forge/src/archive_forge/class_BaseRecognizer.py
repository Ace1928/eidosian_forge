        enclosing rule. This local follow set only includes tokens
        from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
        ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.

        EXAMPLE

        When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
        consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r.  The best
        thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
        can legally follow a call to r *or* any rule that called r.
        You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
        input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
        rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.

        Consider grammar:

        a : '[' b ']'
          | '(' b ')'
          ;
        b : c '^' INT ;
        c : ID
          | INT
          ;

        At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
        that rule is pushed on a stack.  Here are the various "local"
        follow sets:

        FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
        FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
        FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'

        Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is

        a -> b -> c

        and, hence, the follow context stack is:

        depth  local follow set     after call to rule
          0         \\<EOF>                    a (from main())
          1          ']'                     b
          3          '^'                     c

        Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
        been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
        included.

        For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
        (context-sensitive or otherwise).  We need the combined set of
        all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
        could follow any reference in the call chain.  We need to
        resync to one of those tokens.  Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
        we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF.  We need to
        sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
        In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is in this set so we would
        not consume anything and after printing an error rule c would
        return normally.  It would not find the required '^' though.
        At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
        exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
        set).  The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
        the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.  Rule b
        exits normally returning to rule a.  Now it finds the ']' (and
        with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).

        So, you cna see that the parser walks up call chain looking
        for the token that was a member of the recovery set.

        Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.

        ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:

        "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" by Niklaus Wirth

        and

        "A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers":
        http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905

        Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:

        "Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent
        Parsers":
        ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip

        Like Grosch I implemented local FOLLOW sets that are combined
        at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
        """

    def computeContextSensitiveRuleFOLLOW(self):
        """
        Compute the context-sensitive FOLLOW set for current rule.
        This is set of token types that can follow a specific rule
        reference given a specific call chain.  You get the set of
        viable tokens that can possibly come next (lookahead depth 1)
        given the current call chain.  Contrast this with the
        definition of plain FOLLOW for rule r:

         FOLLOW(r)={x | S=>*alpha r beta in G and x in FIRST(beta)}

        where x in T* and alpha, beta in V*; T is set of terminals and
        V is the set of terminals and nonterminals.  In other words,
        FOLLOW(r) is the set of all tokens that can possibly follow
        references to r in *any* sentential form (context).  At
        runtime, however, we know precisely which context applies as
        we have the call chain.  We may compute the exact (rather
        than covering superset) set of following tokens.

        For example, consider grammar:

        stat : ID '=' expr ';'      // FOLLOW(stat)=={EOF}
             | "return" expr '.'
             ;
        expr : atom ('+' atom)* ;   // FOLLOW(expr)=={';','.',')'}
        atom : INT                  // FOLLOW(atom)=={'+',')',';','.'}
             | '(' expr ')'
             ;

        The FOLLOW sets are all inclusive whereas context-sensitive
        FOLLOW sets are precisely what could follow a rule reference.
        For input input "i=(3);", here is the derivation:

        stat => ID '=' expr ';'
             => ID '=' atom ('+' atom)* ';'
             => ID '=' '(' expr ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
             => ID '=' '(' atom ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
             => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
             => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ';'

        At the "3" token, you'd have a call chain of

          stat -> expr -> atom -> expr -> atom

        What can follow that specific nested ref to atom?  Exactly ')'
        as you can see by looking at the derivation of this specific
        input.  Contrast this with the FOLLOW(atom)={'+',')',';','.'}.

        You want the exact viable token set when recovering from a
        token mismatch.  Upon token mismatch, if LA(1) is member of
        the viable next token set, then you know there is most likely
        a missing token in the input stream.  "Insert" one by just not
