    In reStructuredText_, there is no way to specify a document title
    and subtitle explicitly. Instead, we can supply the document title
    (and possibly the subtitle as well) implicitly, and use this
    two-step transform to "raise" or "promote" the title(s) (and their
    corresponding section contents) to the document level.

    1. If the document contains a single top-level section as its
       first non-comment element, the top-level section's title
       becomes the document's title, and the top-level section's
       contents become the document's immediate contents. The lone
       top-level section header must be the first non-comment element
       in the document.

       For example, take this input text::

           =================
            Top-Level Title
           =================

           A paragraph.

       Once parsed, it looks like this::

           <document>
               <section names="top-level title">
                   <title>
                       Top-Level Title
                   <paragraph>
                       A paragraph.

       After running the DocTitle transform, we have::

           <document names="top-level title">
               <title>
                   Top-Level Title
               <paragraph>
                   A paragraph.

    2. If step 1 successfully determines the document title, we
       continue by checking for a subtitle.

       If the lone top-level section itself contains a single
       second-level section as its first non-comment element, that
       section's title is promoted to the document's subtitle, and
       that section's contents become the document's immediate
       contents. Given this input text::

           =================
            Top-Level Title
           =================

           Second-Level Title
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

           A paragraph.

       After parsing and running the Section Promotion transform, the
       result is::

           <document names="top-level title">
               <title>
                   Top-Level Title
               <subtitle names="second-level title">
                   Second-Level Title
               <paragraph>
                   A paragraph.

       (Note that the implicit hyperlink target generated by the
       "Second-Level Title" is preserved on the "subtitle" element
       itself.)

    Any comment elements occurring before the document title or
    subtitle are accumulated and inserted as the first body elements
    after the title(s).

    This transform also sets the document's metadata title
    (document['title']).
