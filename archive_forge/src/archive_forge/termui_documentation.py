This command stops execution and waits for the user to press any
    key to continue.  This is similar to the Windows batch "pause"
    command.  If the program is not run through a terminal, this command
    will instead do nothing.

    .. versionadded:: 4.0
       Added the `err` parameter.

    :param info: The message to print before pausing. Defaults to
        ``"Press any key to continue..."``.
    :param err: if set to message goes to ``stderr`` instead of
                ``stdout``, the same as with echo.
