    CvssVersionValueValuesEnum: Output only. CVSS version used to populate
      cvss_score and severity.
    EffectiveSeverityValueValuesEnum: The distro assigned severity for this
      vulnerability when it is available, otherwise this is the note provider
      assigned severity. When there are multiple PackageIssues for this
      vulnerability, they can have different effective severities because some
      might be provided by the distro while others are provided by the
      language ecosystem for a language pack. For this reason, it is advised
      to use the effective severity on the PackageIssue level. In the case
      where multiple PackageIssues have differing effective severities, this
      field should be the highest severity for any of the PackageIssues.
    SeverityValueValuesEnum: Output only. The note provider assigned severity
      of this vulnerability.

  Fields:
    cvssScore: Output only. The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score
      is on a scale of 0 - 10 where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates
      high severity.
    cvssV2: The cvss v2 score for the vulnerability.
    cvssVersion: Output only. CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and
      severity.
    cvssv3: The cvss v3 score for the vulnerability.
    effectiveSeverity: The distro assigned severity for this vulnerability
      when it is available, otherwise this is the note provider assigned
      severity. When there are multiple PackageIssues for this vulnerability,
      they can have different effective severities because some might be

      effective severity on the PackageIssue level. In the case where multiple
      PackageIssues have differing effective severities, this field should be
      the highest severity for any of the PackageIssues.
    extraDetails: Occurrence-specific extra details about the vulnerability.
    fixAvailable: Output only. Whether at least one of the affected packages
      has a fix available.
    longDescription: Output only. A detailed description of this
      vulnerability.
    packageIssue: Required. The set of affected locations and their fixes (if
      available) within the associated resource.
    relatedUrls: Output only. URLs related to this vulnerability.
    severity: Output only. The note provider assigned severity of this
      vulnerability.
    shortDescription: Output only. A one sentence description of this
      vulnerability.
    type: The type of package; whether native or non native (e.g., ruby gems,
      node.js packages, etc.).
    vexAssessment: A VexAssessment attribute.
