    detailed_help = {'DESCRIPTION': "          {description}\n\n          *gcloud* supports list-type and dictionary-type flags that take one\n          argument which is a list of one or more comma-separated items:\n\n              --list-flag=value1,value2,value3\n\n              --dict-flag=key1=value1,key2=value2\n\n          In the case of a dict-type flag, each item is a key-value pair\n          separated by '='. If more than one '=' is present, the first is used.\n\n          In order to include commas in your arguments, specify an alternate\n          delimiter using the following syntax:\n\n              ^DELIM^flag value, with comma\n\n          where _DELIM_ is a sequence of one or more characters that may not\n          appear in any value in the list.\n\n          NOTE: In cmd.exe and PowerShell on Windows, `^` is a special character\n          and you must escape it by repeating it. In the following examples,\n          every time you see `^`, replace it with `^^^^`.\n          ", 'EXAMPLES': '          In these examples, a list-type or dictionary-type flag is given, along\n          with a shell comment explaining how it is parsed. The parsed flags are\n          shown here using Python-style list or dict formats (in other\n          languages, what Python calls "dicts" are often called "associative\n          arrays," "maps," or "hashes").\n\n          Basic example:\n\n              --list-flag=^:^a,b:c,d # => [\'a,b\', \'c,d\']\n\n          Multi-character delimiters are allowed:\n\n              --list-flag=^--^a-,b--c # => [\'a-,b\', \'c\']\n\n          Just one \'^\' has no special meaning:\n\n              --list-flag=^a,b,c # => [\'^a\', \'b\', \'c\']\n\n          This is an alternative way of starting with \'^\':\n\n              --list-flag=^,^^a,b,c # => [\'^a\', \'b\', \'c\']\n\n          A \'^\' anywhere but the start has no special meaning:\n\n              --list-flag=a^:^,b,c # => [\'a^:^\', \'b\', \'c\']\n\n          Dictionary-type arguments work exactly the same as list-type\n          arguments:\n\n              --dict-flag=^:^a=b,c:d=f,g # => {\'a\': \'b,c\', \'d\': \'f,g\'}\n\n          To reserve ephemeral IP addresses, passed in as a list, which are\n          being used by virtual machine instances in the us-central1 region,\n          run:\n\n              $ gcloud compute addresses create               --addresses ^:^123.456.789.198:22.333.146.189:789.312.645               --region us-central1\n\n          To create a Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance\n          with metadata as a list ({\'key1\': \'"value1"\', \'key2\': \'value2\',\n          \'key3\': \'value3Index1,value3Index2\', \'key4\': \'value4\'), run:\n\n              $ gcloud compute instances create example-instance1               --metadata ^:^key1="value1":key2=value2:key3=value3Index1,value3Index2,valueIndex3:key4=value4\n          '}
