    """Calculate Binary Cross Entropy between target and input logits.

    See :class:`~torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` for details.

    Args:
        input: Tensor of arbitrary shape as unnormalized scores (often referred to as logits).
        target: Tensor of the same shape as input with values between 0 and 1
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight
            if provided it's repeated to match input tensor shape
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        pos_weight (Tensor, optional): a weight of positive examples to be broadcasted with target.
            Must be a tensor with equal size along the class dimension to the number of classes.
            Pay close attention to PyTorch's broadcasting semantics in order to achieve the desired
            operations. For a target of size [B, C, H, W] (where B is batch size) pos_weight of
            size [B, C, H, W] will apply different pos_weights to each element of the batch or
            [C, H, W] the same pos_weights across the batch. To apply the same positive weight
            along all spacial dimensions for a 2D multi-class target [C, H, W] use: [C, 1, 1].
            Default: ``None``

    Examples::

         >>> input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
         >>> target = torch.empty(3).random_(2)
         >>> loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(input, target)
         >>> loss.backward()
