def solve_event_equation(event, sol, t_old, t):
    """Solve an equation corresponding to an ODE event.

    The equation is ``event(t, y(t)) = 0``, here ``y(t)`` is known from an
    ODE solver using some sort of interpolation. It is solved by
    `scipy.optimize.brentq` with xtol=atol=4*EPS.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event : callable
        Function ``event(t, y)``.
    sol : callable
        Function ``sol(t)`` which evaluates an ODE solution between `t_old`
        and  `t`.
    t_old, t : float
        Previous and new values of time. They will be used as a bracketing
        interval.

    Returns
    -------
    root : float
        Found solution.
