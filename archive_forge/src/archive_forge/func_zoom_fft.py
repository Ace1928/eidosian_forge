def zoom_fft(x, fn, m=None, *, fs=2, endpoint=False, axis=-1):
    """
    Compute the DFT of `x` only for frequencies in range `fn`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        The signal to transform.
    fn : array_like
        A length-2 sequence [`f1`, `f2`] giving the frequency range, or a
        scalar, for which the range [0, `fn`] is assumed.
    m : int, optional
        The number of points to evaluate.  The default is the length of `x`.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency.  If ``fs=10`` represented 10 kHz, for example,
        then `f1` and `f2` would also be given in kHz.
        The default sampling frequency is 2, so `f1` and `f2` should be
        in the range [0, 1] to keep the transform below the Nyquist
        frequency.
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, `f2` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is False.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to compute the FFT. If not given, the last axis is
        used.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The transformed signal.  The Fourier transform will be calculated
        at the points f1, f1+df, f1+2df, ..., f2, where df=(f2-f1)/m.

    See Also
    --------
    ZoomFFT : Class that creates a callable partial FFT function.
    scipy.signal.zoom_fft

    Notes
    -----
    The defaults are chosen such that ``signal.zoom_fft(x, 2)`` is equivalent
    to ``fft.fft(x)`` and, if ``m > len(x)``, that ``signal.zoom_fft(x, 2, m)``
    is equivalent to ``fft.fft(x, m)``.

    To graph the magnitude of the resulting transform, use::

        plot(linspace(f1, f2, m, endpoint=False),
             abs(zoom_fft(x, [f1, f2], m)))

    If the transform needs to be repeated, use `ZoomFFT` to construct
    a specialized transform function which can be reused without
    recomputing constants.
