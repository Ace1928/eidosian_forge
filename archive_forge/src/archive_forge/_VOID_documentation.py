    Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)

    The Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF
    datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and users of RDF data, with applications ranging
    from data discovery to cataloging and archiving of datasets. This document provides a formal definition of the
    new RDF classes and properties introduced for VoID. It is a companion to the main specification document for
    VoID, <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/">Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary</a></em>.
