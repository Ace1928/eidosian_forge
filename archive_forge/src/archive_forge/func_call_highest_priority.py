    """A decorator for binary special methods to handle _op_priority.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Binary special methods in Expr and its subclasses use a special attribute
    '_op_priority' to determine whose special method will be called to
    handle the operation. In general, the object having the highest value of
    '_op_priority' will handle the operation. Expr and subclasses that define
    custom binary special methods (__mul__, etc.) should decorate those
    methods with this decorator to add the priority logic.

    The ``method_name`` argument is the name of the method of the other class
    that will be called.  Use this decorator in the following manner::

        # Call other.__rmul__ if other._op_priority > self._op_priority
        @call_highest_priority('__rmul__')
        def __mul__(self, other):
            ...

        # Call other.__mul__ if other._op_priority > self._op_priority
        @call_highest_priority('__mul__')
        def __rmul__(self, other):
        ...
    """
