This class implements the password hash used by MS-SQL 2005, and follows the :ref:`password-hash-api`.

    It supports a fixed-length salt.

    The :meth:`~passlib.ifc.PasswordHash.using` method accepts the following optional keywords:

    :type salt: bytes
    :param salt:
        Optional salt string.
        If not specified, one will be autogenerated (this is recommended).
        If specified, it must be 4 bytes in length.

    :type relaxed: bool
    :param relaxed:
        By default, providing an invalid value for one of the other
        keywords will result in a :exc:`ValueError`. If ``relaxed=True``,
        and the error can be corrected, a :exc:`~passlib.exc.PasslibHashWarning`
        will be issued instead. Correctable errors include
        ``salt`` strings that are too long.
