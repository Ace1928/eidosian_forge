    OVERRIDDEN - Whether an argument can be 'overridden' by a later argument.
        For example, -DFOO defines FOO and -UFOO undefines FOO. In this case,
        we can safely remove the previous occurrence and add a new one. The
        same is true for include paths and library paths with -I and -L.
    UNIQUE - Arguments that once specified cannot be undone, such as `-c` or
        `-pipe`. New instances of these can be completely skipped.
    NO_DEDUP - Whether it matters where or how many times on the command-line
        a particular argument is present. This can matter for symbol
        resolution in static or shared libraries, so we cannot de-dup or
        reorder them.
