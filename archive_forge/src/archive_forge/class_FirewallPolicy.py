    """Represents a Firewall Policy resource.

  Fields:
    associations: A list of associations that belong to this firewall policy.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    displayName: Deprecated, please use short name instead. User-provided name
      of the Organization firewall policy. The name should be unique in the
      organization in which the firewall policy is created. This field is not
      applicable to network firewall policies. This name must be set on
      creation and cannot be changed. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
      and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
      means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    fingerprint: Specifies a fingerprint for this resource, which is
      essentially a hash of the metadata's contents and used for optimistic
      locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
      changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must
      always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to
      the firewall policy.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewallPolicyfor
      firewall policies
    name: Name of the resource. For Organization Firewall Policies it's a
      [Output Only] numeric ID allocated by Google Cloud which uniquely
      identifies the Organization Firewall Policy.
    parent: [Output Only] The parent of the firewall policy. This field is not
      applicable to network firewall policies.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional firewall policy
      resides. This field is not applicable to global firewall policies. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    ruleTupleCount: [Output Only] Total count of all firewall policy rule
      tuples. A firewall policy can not exceed a set number of tuples.
    rules: A list of rules that belong to this policy. There must always be a
      default rule (rule with priority 2147483647 and match "*"). If no rules
      are provided when creating a firewall policy, a default rule with action
      "allow" will be added.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    shortName: User-provided name of the Organization firewall policy. The
      name should be unique in the organization in which the firewall policy
      is created. This field is not applicable to network firewall policies.
      This name must be set on creation and cannot be changed. The name must
      be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name
      must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a
      lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
      letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
