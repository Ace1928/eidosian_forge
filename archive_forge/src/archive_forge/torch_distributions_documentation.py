Creates this Distribution from logits (and additional arguments).

        If you wish to create this distribution from logits only, please refer to
        `Distribution.get_partial_dist_cls()`.

        Args:
            logits: The tensor containing logits to be separated by `input_lens`.
                child_distribution_cls_struct: A struct of Distribution classes that can
                be instantiated from the given logits.
            child_distribution_cls_struct: A struct of Distribution classes that can
                be instantiated from the given logits.
            input_lens: A list or dict of integers that indicate the length of each
                logit. If this is given as a dict, the structure should match the
                structure of child_distribution_cls_struct.
            space: The possibly nested output space.
            **kwargs: Forward compatibility kwargs.

        Returns:
            A TorchMultiActionDistribution object.
