Do the actual printing.

        This prints the generated output in an aligned, pretty form. it aims
        for a total width of 160 characters, but will use whatever the tty
        reports it's value to be. Though this is much wider than the standard
        80 characters of terminals, and even than the newer 120, compressing
        it to those lengths makes the output hard to read.

        Each column will have a specific width, and will be line wrapped.
