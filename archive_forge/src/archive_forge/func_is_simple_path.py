def is_simple_path(G, nodes):
    """Returns True if and only if `nodes` form a simple path in `G`.

    A *simple path* in a graph is a nonempty sequence of nodes in which
    no node appears more than once in the sequence, and each adjacent
    pair of nodes in the sequence is adjacent in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A NetworkX graph.
    nodes : list
        A list of one or more nodes in the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the given list of nodes represents a simple path in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    An empty list of nodes is not a path but a list of one node is a
    path. Here's an explanation why.

    This function operates on *node paths*. One could also consider
    *edge paths*. There is a bijection between node paths and edge
    paths.

    The *length of a path* is the number of edges in the path, so a list
    of nodes of length *n* corresponds to a path of length *n* - 1.
    Thus the smallest edge path would be a list of zero edges, the empty
    path. This corresponds to a list of one node.

    To convert between a node path and an edge path, you can use code
    like the following::

        >>> from networkx.utils import pairwise
        >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> edges = list(pairwise(nodes))
        >>> edges
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        >>> nodes = [edges[0][0]] + [v for u, v in edges]
        >>> nodes
        [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [2, 3, 0])
    True
    >>> nx.is_simple_path(G, [0, 2])
    False
