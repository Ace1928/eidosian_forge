    """Fast approximation of log2(x) for an mpf value tuple x.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Calculated as exponent + width of mantissa. This is an
    approximation for two reasons: 1) it gives the ceil(log2(abs(x)))
    value and 2) it is too high by 1 in the case that x is an exact
    power of 2. Although this is easy to remedy by testing to see if
    the odd mpf mantissa is 1 (indicating that one was dealing with
    an exact power of 2) that would decrease the speed and is not
    necessary as this is only being used as an approximation for the
    number of bits in x. The correct return value could be written as
    "x[2] + (x[3] if x[1] != 1 else 0)".
        Since mpf tuples always have an odd mantissa, no check is done
    to see if the mantissa is a multiple of 2 (in which case the
    result would be too large by 1).

    Examples

    >>> n = [1, -1][s]*m*2**e
    >>> n, (log(n)/log(2)).evalf(2), fastlog((s, m, e, bc))
