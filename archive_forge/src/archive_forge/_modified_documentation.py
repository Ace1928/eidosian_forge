    Is target out-of-date with respect to any file in sources.

    Return True if 'target' is out-of-date with respect to any file
    listed in 'sources'. In other words, if 'target' exists and is newer
    than every file in 'sources', return False; otherwise return True.
    ``missing`` controls how to handle a missing source file:

    - error (default): allow the ``stat()`` call to fail.
    - ignore: silently disregard any missing source files.
    - newer: treat missing source files as "target out of date". This
      mode is handy in "dry-run" mode: it will pretend to carry out
      commands that wouldn't work because inputs are missing, but
      that doesn't matter because dry-run won't run the commands.
