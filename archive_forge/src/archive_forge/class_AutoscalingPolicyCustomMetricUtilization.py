    """Custom utilization metric policy.

  Enums:
    UtilizationTargetTypeValueValuesEnum: Defines how target utilization value
      is expressed for a Stackdriver Monitoring metric. Either GAUGE,
      DELTA_PER_SECOND, or DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
      string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
      specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
      whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For the
      filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply:
      - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You can
      only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any functions
      for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both the filter
      string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places,
      the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines
      what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a
      gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate
      TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot
      filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the
      autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the
      entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be
      performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
      This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If
      not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a
      filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the
      autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using
      gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon
      the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to
      obtain its scaling value.
    metric: The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The
      metric cannot have negative values. The metric must have a value type of
      INT64 or DOUBLE.
    singleInstanceAssignment: If scaling is based on a per-group metric value
      that represents the total amount of work to be done or resource usage,
      set this value to an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled
      group. Autoscaler keeps the number of instances proportional to the
      value of this metric. The metric itself does not change value due to
      group resizing. A good metric to use with the target is for example
      pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a custom
      metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your instances.
      A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median latency,
      since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance,
      it could be better used with utilization_target instead.
    utilizationTarget: The target value of the metric that autoscaler
      maintains. This must be a positive value. A utilization metric scales
      number of virtual machines handling requests to increase or decrease
      proportionally to the metric. For example, a good metric to use as a
      utilization_target is https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/net
      work/received_bytes_count. The autoscaler works to keep this value
      constant for each of the instances.
    utilizationTargetType: Defines how target utilization value is expressed
      for a Stackdriver Monitoring metric. Either GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND, or
      DELTA_PER_MINUTE.
