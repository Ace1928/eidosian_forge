        Performs the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) basis reduction algorithm.
        See [1]_ and [2]_.

        Parameters
        ==========

        delta : QQ, optional
            The Lovász parameter. Must be in the interval (0.25, 1), with larger
            values producing a more reduced basis. The default is 0.75 for
            historical reasons.

        Returns
        =======

        The reduced basis as a DomainMatrix over ZZ.

        Throws
        ======

        DMValueError: if delta is not in the range (0.25, 1)
        DMShapeError: if the matrix is not of shape (m, n) with m <= n
        DMDomainError: if the matrix domain is not ZZ
        DMRankError: if the matrix contains linearly dependent rows

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.polys.domains import ZZ, QQ
        >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DM
        >>> x = DM([[1, 0, 0, 0, -20160],
        ...         [0, 1, 0, 0, 33768],
        ...         [0, 0, 1, 0, 39578],
        ...         [0, 0, 0, 1, 47757]], ZZ)
        >>> y = DM([[10, -3, -2, 8, -4],
        ...         [3, -9, 8, 1, -11],
        ...         [-3, 13, -9, -3, -9],
        ...         [-12, -7, -11, 9, -1]], ZZ)
        >>> assert x.lll(delta=QQ(5, 6)) == y

        Notes
        =====

        The implementation is derived from the Maple code given in Figures 4.3
        and 4.4 of [3]_ (pp.68-69). It uses the efficient method of only calculating
        state updates as they are required.
