    Parameters
    ----------
    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    predecessors: dictionary
       Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of predecessors in the

    -------
    path : list
       A list of nodes containing the shortest path from source to target

       If source and target are the same, an empty list is returned
