    """The specification for cookie-based stateful session affinity where the
  date plane supplies a "session cookie" with the name "GSSA" which encodes a
  specific destination host and each request containing that cookie will be
  directed to that host as long as the destination host remains up and
  healthy. The gRPC proxyless mesh library or sidecar proxy will manage the
  session cookie but the client application code is responsible for copying
  the cookie from each RPC in the session to the next.

  Fields:
    cookieTtl: Required. The cookie TTL value for the Set-Cookie header
      generated by the data plane. The lifetime of the cookie may be set to a
      value from 1 to 86400 seconds (24 hours) inclusive.
