        Set the smoother output

        The smoother can produce several types of results. The smoother output
        variable controls which are calculated and returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        smoother_output : int, optional
            Bitmask value to set the smoother output to. See notes for details.
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments may be used to influence the smoother output by
            setting individual boolean flags. See notes for details.

        Notes
        -----
        The smoother output is defined by a collection of boolean flags, and
        is internally stored as a bitmask. The methods available are:

        SMOOTHER_STATE = 0x01
            Calculate and return the smoothed states.
        SMOOTHER_STATE_COV = 0x02
            Calculate and return the smoothed state covariance matrices.
        SMOOTHER_STATE_AUTOCOV = 0x10
            Calculate and return the smoothed state lag-one autocovariance
            matrices.
        SMOOTHER_DISTURBANCE = 0x04
            Calculate and return the smoothed state and observation
            disturbances.
        SMOOTHER_DISTURBANCE_COV = 0x08
            Calculate and return the covariance matrices for the smoothed state
            and observation disturbances.
        SMOOTHER_ALL
            Calculate and return all results.

        If the bitmask is set directly via the `smoother_output` argument, then
        the full method must be provided.

        If keyword arguments are used to set individual boolean flags, then
        the lowercase of the method must be used as an argument name, and the
        value is the desired value of the boolean flag (True or False).

        Note that the smoother output may also be specified by directly
        modifying the class attributes which are defined similarly to the
        keyword arguments.

        The default smoother output is SMOOTHER_ALL.

        If performance is a concern, only those results which are needed should
        be specified as any results that are not specified will not be
        calculated. For example, if the smoother output is set to only include
        SMOOTHER_STATE, the smoother operates much more quickly than if all
        output is required.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import statsmodels.tsa.statespace.kalman_smoother as ks
        >>> mod = ks.KalmanSmoother(1,1)
        >>> mod.smoother_output
        15
        >>> mod.set_smoother_output(smoother_output=0)
        >>> mod.smoother_state = True
        >>> mod.smoother_output
        1
        >>> mod.smoother_state
        True
