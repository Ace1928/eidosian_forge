    """DataLabelingJob is used to trigger a human labeling job on unlabeled
  data from the following Dataset:

  Enums:
    StateValueValuesEnum: Output only. The detailed state of the job.

  Messages:
    AnnotationLabelsValue: Labels to assign to annotations generated by this
      DataLabelingJob. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
      characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters,
      numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
      allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of
      labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with
      "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable.
    LabelsValue: The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
      DataLabelingJobs. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
      characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters,
      numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
      allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of
      labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with
      "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable. Following system labels
      exist for each DataLabelingJob: * "aiplatform.googleapis.com/schema":
      output only, its value is the inputs_schema's title.

  Fields:
    activeLearningConfig: Parameters that configure the active learning
      pipeline. Active learning will label the data incrementally via several
      iterations. For every iteration, it will select a batch of data based on
      the sampling strategy.
    annotationLabels: Labels to assign to annotations generated by this
      DataLabelingJob. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
      characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters,
      numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
      allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of
      labels. System reserved label keys are prefixed with
      "aiplatform.googleapis.com/" and are immutable.
    createTime: Output only. Timestamp when this DataLabelingJob was created.
    currentSpend: Output only. Estimated cost(in US dollars) that the
      DataLabelingJob has incurred to date.
    datasets: Required. Dataset resource names. Right now we only support
      labeling from a single Dataset. Format:
      `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}`
    displayName: Required. The user-defined name of the DataLabelingJob. The
      name can be up to 128 characters long and can consist of any UTF-8
      characters. Display name of a DataLabelingJob.
    encryptionSpec: Customer-managed encryption key spec for a
      DataLabelingJob. If set, this DataLabelingJob will be secured by this
      key. Note: Annotations created in the DataLabelingJob are associated
      with the EncryptionSpec of the Dataset they are exported to.
    error: Output only. DataLabelingJob errors. It is only populated when
      job's state is `JOB_STATE_FAILED` or `JOB_STATE_CANCELLED`.
    inputs: Required. Input config parameters for the DataLabelingJob.
    inputsSchemaUri: Required. Points to a YAML file stored on Google Cloud
      Storage describing the config for a specific type of DataLabelingJob.
      The schema files that can be used here are found in the
      https://storage.googleapis.com/google-cloud-aiplatform bucket in the
      /schema/datalabelingjob/inputs/ folder.
    instructionUri: Required. The Google Cloud Storage location of the
      instruction pdf. This pdf is shared with labelers, and provides detailed
      description on how to label DataItems in Datasets.
    labelerCount: Required. Number of labelers to work on each DataItem.
    labelingProgress: Output only. Current labeling job progress percentage
      scaled in interval [0, 100], indicating the percentage of DataItems that
      has been finished.
    labels: The labels with user-defined metadata to organize your
      DataLabelingJobs. Label keys and values can be no longer than 64
      characters (Unicode codepoints), can only contain lowercase letters,
      numeric characters, underscores and dashes. International characters are
      allowed. See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information and examples of

    name: Output only. Resource name of the DataLabelingJob.
    specialistPools: The SpecialistPools' resource names associated with this
      job.
    state: Output only. The detailed state of the job.
    updateTime: Output only. Timestamp when this DataLabelingJob was updated
      most recently.
