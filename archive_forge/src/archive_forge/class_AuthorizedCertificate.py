    """An SSL certificate that a user has been authorized to administer. A user
  is authorized to administer any certificate that applies to one of their
  authorized domains.

  Fields:
    certificateRawData: The SSL certificate serving the AuthorizedCertificate
      resource. This must be obtained independently from a certificate
      authority.
    displayName: The user-specified display name of the certificate. This is
      not guaranteed to be unique. Example: My Certificate.
    domainMappingsCount: Aggregate count of the domain mappings with this
      certificate mapped. This count includes domain mappings on applications
      for which the user does not have VIEWER permissions.Only returned by GET
      or LIST requests when specifically requested by the
      view=FULL_CERTIFICATE option.@OutputOnly
    domainNames: Topmost applicable domains of this certificate. This
      certificate applies to these domains and their subdomains. Example:
      example.com.@OutputOnly
    expireTime: The time when this certificate expires. To update the renewal
      time on this certificate, upload an SSL certificate with a different
      expiration time using
      AuthorizedCertificates.UpdateAuthorizedCertificate.@OutputOnly
    id: Relative name of the certificate. This is a unique value autogenerated
      on AuthorizedCertificate resource creation. Example: 12345.@OutputOnly
    managedCertificate: Only applicable if this certificate is managed by App
      Engine. Managed certificates are tied to the lifecycle of a
      DomainMapping and cannot be updated or deleted via the
      AuthorizedCertificates API. If this certificate is manually administered
      by the user, this field will be empty.@OutputOnly
    name: Full path to the AuthorizedCertificate resource in the API. Example:
      apps/myapp/authorizedCertificates/12345.@OutputOnly
    visibleDomainMappings: The full paths to user visible Domain Mapping
      resources that have this certificate mapped. Example:
      apps/myapp/domainMappings/example.com.This may not represent the full
      list of mapped domain mappings if the user does not have VIEWER
      permissions on all of the applications that have this certificate
      mapped. See domain_mappings_count for a complete count.Only returned by
      GET or LIST requests when specifically requested by the
