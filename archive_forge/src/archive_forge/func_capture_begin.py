    """Begin capturing CUDA work on the current stream.

        Typically, you shouldn't call ``capture_begin`` yourself.
        Use :class:`~torch.cuda.graph` or :func:`~torch.cuda.make_graphed_callables`,
        which call ``capture_begin`` internally.

        Arguments:
            pool (optional): Token (returned by :func:`~torch.cuda.graph_pool_handle` or
                :meth:`other_Graph_instance.pool()<torch.cuda.CUDAGraph.pool>`) that hints this graph may share memory
                with the indicated pool.  See :ref:`Graph memory management<graph-memory-management>`.
            capture_error_mode (str, optional): specifies the cudaStreamCaptureMode for the graph capture stream.
                Can be "global", "thread_local" or "relaxed". During cuda graph capture, some actions, such as cudaMalloc,
                may be unsafe. "global" will error on actions in other threads, "thread_local" will only error for
                actions in the current thread, and "relaxed" will not error on these actions. Do NOT change this setting
                unless you're familiar with `cudaStreamCaptureMode <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__STREAM.html#group__CUDART__STREAM_1g9d0535d93a214cbf126835257b16ba85>`_
