    Convert a linear system of ODEs to matrix form

    Explanation
    ===========

    Express a system of linear ordinary differential equations as a single
    matrix differential equation [1]. For example the system $x' = x + y + 1$
    and $y' = x - y$ can be represented as

    .. math:: A_1 X' = A_0 X + b

    where $A_1$ and $A_0$ are $2 \\times 2$ matrices and $b$, $X$ and $X'$ are
    $2 \\times 1$ matrices with $X = [x, y]^T$.

    Higher-order systems are represented with additional matrices e.g. a
    second-order system would look like

    .. math:: A_2 X'' =  A_1 X' + A_0 X  + b

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Function, Symbol, Matrix, Eq
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import linear_ode_to_matrix
    >>> t = Symbol('t')
    >>> x = Function('x')
    >>> y = Function('y')

    We can create a system of linear ODEs like

    >>> eqs = [
    ...     Eq(x(t).diff(t), x(t) + y(t) + 1),
    ...     Eq(y(t).diff(t), x(t) - y(t)),
    ... ]
    >>> funcs = [x(t), y(t)]
    >>> order = 1 # 1st order system

    Now ``linear_ode_to_matrix`` can represent this as a matrix
    differential equation.

    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, order)
    >>> A1
    Matrix([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]])
    >>> A0
    Matrix([
    [1, 1],
    [1,  -1]])
    >>> b
    Matrix([
    [1],
    [0]])

    The original equations can be recovered from these matrices:

    >>> eqs_mat = Matrix([eq.lhs - eq.rhs for eq in eqs])
    >>> X = Matrix(funcs)
    >>> A1 * X.diff(t) - A0 * X - b == eqs_mat
    True

    If the system of equations has a maximum order greater than the
    order of the system specified, a ODEOrderError exception is raised.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(x(t).diff(t, 2), x(t).diff(t) + x(t)), Eq(y(t).diff(t), y(t) + x(t))]
    >>> linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ODEOrderError: Cannot represent system in 1-order form

    If the system of equations is nonlinear, then ODENonlinearError is
    raised.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(x(t).diff(t), x(t) + y(t)), Eq(y(t).diff(t), y(t)**2 + x(t))]
    >>> linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ODENonlinearError: The system of ODEs is nonlinear.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs : list of SymPy expressions or equalities

    t : symbol
        The independent variable.
    order : int

    Returns
    =======

    the matrix representing the rhs of the matrix equation.

    Raises
    ======

        When the system of ODEs have an order greater than what was specified
    ODENonlinearError
