    DimensionsValue: If this map is nonempty, then this override applies only
      to specific values for dimensions defined in the limit unit.  For
      example, an override on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region} could
      contain an entry with the key "region" and the value "us-east-1"; the
      override is only applied to quota consumed in that region.  This map has
      the following restrictions: - Keys that are not defined in the limit's
      unit are not valid keys.   Any string appearing in {brackets} in the
      unit (besides {project} or   {user}) is a defined key. - "project" is
      not a valid key; the project is already specified in   the parent
      resource name. - "user" is not a valid key; the API does not support
      quota overrides   that apply only to a specific user. - If "region"
      appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud region. - If "zone"
      appears as a key, its value must be a valid Cloud zone. - If any valid
      key other than "region" or "zone" appears in the map, then   all valid
      keys other than "region" or "zone" must also appear in the map.

    name: The resource name of the override. This name is generated by the
      server when the override is created.  Example names would be: `projects/
      123/services/compute.googleapis.com/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googlea
      pis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/adminOverrides/4a3f2c1d` `proj

      ogleapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/consumerOverrides/4a3f2c1
      d`  The resource name is intended to be opaque and should not be parsed
      for its component strings, since its representation could change in the
      future.
    overrideValue: The overriding quota limit value. Can be any nonnegative
      integer, or -1 (unlimited quota).
