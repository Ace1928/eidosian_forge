def generate_equivalent_ids(gate_seq, return_as_muls=False):
    """Returns a set of equivalent gate identities.

    A gate identity is a quantum circuit such that the product
    of the gates in the circuit is equal to a scalar value.
    For example, XYZ = i, where X, Y, Z are the Pauli gates and
    i is the imaginary value, is considered a gate identity.

    This function uses the four operations (LL, LR, RL, RR)
    to generate the gate rules and, subsequently, to locate equivalent
    gate identities.

    Note that all equivalent identities are reachable in n operations
    from the starting gate identity, where n is the number of gates
    in the sequence.

    The max number of gate identities is 2n, where n is the number
    of gates in the sequence (unproven).

    Parameters
    ==========

    gate_seq : Gate tuple, Mul, or Number
        A variable length tuple or Mul of Gates whose product is equal to
        a scalar matrix.
    return_as_muls: bool
        True to return as Muls; False to return as tuples

    Examples
    ========

    Find equivalent gate identities from the current circuit with tuples:

    >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.identitysearch import generate_equivalent_ids
    >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.gate import X, Y, Z
    >>> x = X(0); y = Y(0); z = Z(0)
    >>> generate_equivalent_ids((x, x))
    {(X(0), X(0))}

    >>> generate_equivalent_ids((x, y, z))
    {(X(0), Y(0), Z(0)), (X(0), Z(0), Y(0)), (Y(0), X(0), Z(0)),
     (Y(0), Z(0), X(0)), (Z(0), X(0), Y(0)), (Z(0), Y(0), X(0))}

    Find equivalent gate identities from the current circuit with Muls:

    >>> generate_equivalent_ids(x*x, return_as_muls=True)
    {1}

    >>> generate_equivalent_ids(x*y*z, return_as_muls=True)
    {X(0)*Y(0)*Z(0), X(0)*Z(0)*Y(0), Y(0)*X(0)*Z(0),
     Y(0)*Z(0)*X(0), Z(0)*X(0)*Y(0), Z(0)*Y(0)*X(0)}
