from collections import defaultdict
from threading import get_ident, main_thread
An extension of `MultiThreadWrapper` that exposes the wrapped instance
    corresponding to the [main_thread()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.main_thread)
    under the `.main_thread` field.

    This is useful for a falling back to a main instance when needed, but results
    in race conditions if used improperly.
