        Converts the output of [`BeitForSemanticSegmentation`] into semantic segmentation maps. Only supports PyTorch.

        Args:
            outputs ([`BeitForSemanticSegmentation`]):
                Raw outputs of the model.
            target_sizes (`List[Tuple]` of length `batch_size`, *optional*):
                List of tuples corresponding to the requested final size (height, width) of each prediction. If unset,
                predictions will not be resized.

        Returns:
            semantic_segmentation: `List[torch.Tensor]` of length `batch_size`, where each item is a semantic
            segmentation map of shape (height, width) corresponding to the target_sizes entry (if `target_sizes` is
            specified). Each entry of each `torch.Tensor` correspond to a semantic class id.
