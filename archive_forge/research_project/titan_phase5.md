
### Phase 5: Extensive Testing and Benchmarking
13. **Extensive Testing**  
    - Develop comprehensive tests covering:
      - Correctness of attention integration in MAC/MAG/MAL variants
      - Memory update and retrieval accuracy
      - Offloading and loading under simulated high-memory scenarios
    - Validate performance metrics (speed, memory usage) under different settings.

14. **Benchmarking Against Baselines**  
    - Run performance benchmarks on language modeling, reasoning tasks, etc., to compare improvements.
    - Profile memory usage, training speed, and scalability with sequence length.
