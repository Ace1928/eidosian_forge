# **📌 Summary of Investigative Approach**
This entire framework makes **clear, testable predictions** and is rooted in known physics. The key assumptions are:  
- **Fundamental laws are not absolute** but emerged from **a deeper pregeometric state.**  
- **The early universe was a state of unrestricted possibility**, where all configurations existed **before selection occurred.**  
- **Symmetry breaking, renormalization, and inflationary selection** stabilized the physical laws we observe today.  
- **Observable signatures exist** in the **CMB, fundamental constant variations, quantum vacuum anomalies, and high-energy physics deviations.**  

Each of these assumptions is now backed by **specific research queries** that can be used to **either support or refute** this framework. This is not just a **thought experiment**—this is a **testable hypothesis** that could **reshape our understanding of why the laws of physics are the way they are.**  

Next step? **Deep-dive into the academic literature, cross-reference results, and refine the model.** This is **real physics** in action. 🚀
