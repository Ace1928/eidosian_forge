Subclasses must override this to perform the filtering.

        The contour is a list of pen (operator, operands) tuples.
        Operators are strings corresponding to the AbstractPen methods:
        "moveTo", "lineTo", "curveTo", "qCurveTo", "closePath" and
        "endPath". The operands are the positional arguments that are
        passed to each method.

        If the method doesn't return a value (i.e. returns None), it's
        assumed that the argument was modified in-place.
        Otherwise, the return value is drawn with the output pen.
