        Rewrite *self* in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials.

        Explanation
        ===========

        If this :py:class:`~.PolyElement` belongs to a ring of $n$ variables,
        we can try to write it as a function of the elementary symmetric
        polynomials on $n$ variables. We compute a symmetric part, and a
        remainder for any part we were not able to symmetrize.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.polys.rings import ring
        >>> from sympy.polys.domains import ZZ
        >>> R, x, y = ring("x,y", ZZ)

        >>> f = x**2 + y**2
        >>> f.symmetrize()
        (x**2 - 2*y, 0, [(x, x + y), (y, x*y)])

        >>> f = x**2 - y**2
        >>> f.symmetrize()
        (x**2 - 2*y, -2*y**2, [(x, x + y), (y, x*y)])

        Returns
        =======

        Triple ``(p, r, m)``
            ``p`` is a :py:class:`~.PolyElement` that represents our attempt
            to express *self* as a function of elementary symmetric
            polynomials. Each variable in ``p`` stands for one of the
            elementary symmetric polynomials. The correspondence is given
            by ``m``.

            ``r`` is the remainder.

            ``m`` is a list of pairs, giving the mapping from variables in
            ``p`` to elementary symmetric polynomials.

            The triple satisfies the equation ``p.compose(m) + r == self``.
            If the remainder ``r`` is zero, *self* is symmetric. If it is
            nonzero, we were not able to represent *self* as symmetric.
