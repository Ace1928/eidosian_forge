Fix characters from one encoding embedded in some other encoding.

        Currently the only situation supported is Windows-1252 (or its
        subset ISO-8859-1), embedded in UTF-8.

        :param in_bytes: A bytestring that you suspect contains
            characters from multiple encodings. Note that this _must_
            be a bytestring. If you've already converted the document
            to Unicode, you're too late.
        :param main_encoding: The primary encoding of `in_bytes`.
        :param embedded_encoding: The encoding that was used to embed characters
            in the main document.
        :return: A bytestring in which `embedded_encoding`
          characters have been converted to their `main_encoding`
          equivalents.
