        Args:
            input_ids (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
                Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary. Padding will be ignored by default should you
                provide it.

                Indices can be obtained using [`AutoTokenizer`]. See [`PreTrainedTokenizer.encode`] and
                [`PreTrainedTokenizer.__call__`] for details.

                [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
            attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

                - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
                - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

                [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
            head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(num_hidden_layers, num_attention_heads)`, *optional*):
                Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

                - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
                - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.

            past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
                Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of
                shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of
                shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`. The two additional
                tensors are only required when the model is used as a decoder in a Sequence to Sequence model.

                Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the
                cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.

                If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `input_ids` (those that
                don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
                `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
            inputs_embeds (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
                Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
                This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors
                than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
            labels (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
                Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ...,
                config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored
                (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.
            use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
                If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding
                (see `past_key_values`).
            output_attentions (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under
                returned tensors for more detail.
            output_hidden_states (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors
                for more detail.
            return_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether or not to return a [`~utils.ModelOutput`] instead of a plain tuple.
