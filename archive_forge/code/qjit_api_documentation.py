from .compiler import (
A :func:`~.qjit` compatible for-loop for PennyLane programs.

    .. note::

        This function only supports the Catalyst compiler. See
        :func:`catalyst.for_loop` for more details.

        Please see the Catalyst :doc:`quickstart guide <catalyst:dev/quick_start>`,
        as well as the :doc:`sharp bits and debugging tips <catalyst:dev/sharp_bits>`
        page for an overview of the differences between Catalyst and PennyLane.

    This decorator provides a functional version of the traditional
    for-loop, similar to `jax.cond.fori_loop <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.fori_loop.html>`__.
    That is, any variables that are modified across iterations need to be provided
    as inputs/outputs to the loop body function:

    - Input arguments contain the value of a variable at the start of an
      iteration.

    - output arguments contain the value at the end of the iteration. The
      outputs are then fed back as inputs to the next iteration.

    The final iteration values are also returned from the transformed
    function.

    The semantics of ``for_loop`` are given by the following Python pseudo-code:

    .. code-block:: python

        def for_loop(lower_bound, upper_bound, step, loop_fn, *args):
            for i in range(lower_bound, upper_bound, step):
                args = loop_fn(i, *args)
            return args

    Unlike ``jax.cond.fori_loop``, the step can be negative if it is known at tracing time
    (i.e., constant). If a non-constant negative step is used, the loop will produce no iterations.

    Args:
        lower_bound (int): starting value of the iteration index
        upper_bound (int): (exclusive) upper bound of the iteration index
        step (int): increment applied to the iteration index at the end of each iteration

    Returns:
        Callable[[int, ...], ...]: A wrapper around the loop body function.
        Note that the loop body function must always have the iteration index as its first
        argument, which can be used arbitrarily inside the loop body. As the value of the index
        across iterations is handled automatically by the provided loop bounds, it must not be
        returned from the function.

    Raises:
        CompileError: if the compiler is not installed

    **Example**


    .. code-block:: python

        dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=1)

        @qml.qjit
        @qml.qnode(dev)
        def circuit(n: int, x: float):

            @qml.for_loop(0, n, 1)
            def loop_rx(i, x):
                # perform some work and update (some of) the arguments
                qml.RX(x, wires=0)

                # update the value of x for the next iteration
                return jnp.sin(x)

            # apply the for loop
            final_x = loop_rx(x)

            return qml.expval(qml.Z(0)), final_x

    >>> circuit(7, 1.6)
    (array(0.97926626), array(0.55395718))
