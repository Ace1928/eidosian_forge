Adds SOC constraint to the model using the data from mat and vec.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : GUROBI model
            The problem model.
        variables : list
            The problem variables.
        rows : range
            The rows to be constrained.
        mat : SciPy COO matrix
            The matrix representing the constraints.
        vec : NDArray
            The constant part of the constraints.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            A tuple of (QConstr, list of Constr, and list of variables).
