    """Register a URL value preprocessor function for all view
        functions in the application. These functions will be called before the
        :meth:`before_request` functions.

        The function can modify the values captured from the matched url before
        they are passed to the view. For example, this can be used to pop a
        common language code value and place it in ``g`` rather than pass it to
        every view.

        The function is passed the endpoint name and values dict. The return
        value is ignored.

        This is available on both app and blueprint objects. When used on an app, this
        is called for every request. When used on a blueprint, this is called for
        requests that the blueprint handles. To register with a blueprint and affect
        every request, use :meth:`.Blueprint.app_url_value_preprocessor`.
