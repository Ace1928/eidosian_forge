    fingerprint: A fingerprint for the Route Policy being applied to this
      Router, which is essentially a hash of the Route Policy used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update Route Policy.
      You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to
      update or change labels. To see the latest fingerprint, make a
      getRoutePolicy() request to retrieve a Route Policy.
    name: Route Policy name, which must be a resource ID segment and unique
      within all the router's Route Policies. Name should conform to RFC1035.
    terms: List of terms (the order in the list is not important, they are
      evaluated in order of priority). Order of policies is not retained and
      might change when getting policy later.
    type: A TypeValueValuesEnum attribute.
