    Declare a FastAPI Security dependency.

    The only difference with a regular dependency is that it can declare OAuth2
    scopes that will be integrated with OpenAPI and the automatic UI docs (by default
    at `/docs`).

    It takes a single "dependable" callable (like a function).

    Don't call it directly, FastAPI will call it for you.

    Read more about it in the
    [FastAPI docs for Security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/) and
    in the
    [FastAPI docs for OAuth2 scopes](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/oauth2-scopes/).

    **Example**

    ```python
    from typing import Annotated

    from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

    from .db import User
    from .security import get_current_active_user

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/users/me/items/")
    async def read_own_items(
        current_user: Annotated[User, Security(get_current_active_user, scopes=["items"])]
    ):
        return [{"item_id": "Foo", "owner": current_user.username}]
    ```
