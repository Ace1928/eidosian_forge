from plotly.io._utils import validate_coerce_fig_to_dict

    Compute default values for all attributes not specified in the input figure and
    returns the output as a "full" figure. This function calls Plotly.js via Kaleido
    to populate unspecified attributes. This function is intended for interactive use
    during development to learn more about how Plotly.js computes default values and is
    not generally necessary or recommended for production use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fig:
        Figure object or dict representing a figure

    warn: bool
        If False, suppress warnings about not using this in production.

    as_dict: bool
        If True, output is a dict with some keys that go.Figure can't parse.
        If False, output is a go.Figure with unparseable keys skipped.

    Returns
    -------
    plotly.graph_objects.Figure or dict
        The full figure
