class DeclarativeBase(inspection.Inspectable[InstanceState[Any]], metaclass=DeclarativeAttributeIntercept):
    """Base class used for declarative class definitions.

    The :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase` allows for the creation of new
    declarative bases in such a way that is compatible with type checkers::


        from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase

        class Base(DeclarativeBase):
            pass


    The above ``Base`` class is now usable as the base for new declarative
    mappings.  The superclass makes use of the ``__init_subclass__()``
    method to set up new classes and metaclasses aren't used.

    When first used, the :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase` class instantiates a new
    :class:`_orm.registry` to be used with the base, assuming one was not
    provided explicitly. The :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase` class supports
    class-level attributes which act as parameters for the construction of this
    registry; such as to indicate a specific :class:`_schema.MetaData`
    collection as well as a specific value for
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map`::

        from typing_extensions import Annotated

        from sqlalchemy import BigInteger
        from sqlalchemy import MetaData
        from sqlalchemy import String
        from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase

        bigint = Annotated[int, "bigint"]
        my_metadata = MetaData()

        class Base(DeclarativeBase):
            metadata = my_metadata
            type_annotation_map = {
                str: String().with_variant(String(255), "mysql", "mariadb"),
                bigint: BigInteger()
            }

    Class-level attributes which may be specified include:

    :param metadata: optional :class:`_schema.MetaData` collection.
     If a :class:`_orm.registry` is constructed automatically, this
     :class:`_schema.MetaData` collection will be used to construct it.
     Otherwise, the local :class:`_schema.MetaData` collection will supercede
     that used by an existing :class:`_orm.registry` passed using the
     :paramref:`_orm.DeclarativeBase.registry` parameter.
    :param type_annotation_map: optional type annotation map that will be
     passed to the :class:`_orm.registry` as
     :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map`.
    :param registry: supply a pre-existing :class:`_orm.registry` directly.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0  Added :class:`.DeclarativeBase`, so that declarative
       base classes may be constructed in such a way that is also recognized
       by :pep:`484` type checkers.   As a result, :class:`.DeclarativeBase`
       and other subclassing-oriented APIs should be seen as
       superseding previous "class returned by a function" APIs, namely
       :func:`_orm.declarative_base` and :meth:`_orm.registry.generate_base`,
       where the base class returned cannot be recognized by type checkers
       without using plugins.

    **__init__ behavior**

    In a plain Python class, the base-most ``__init__()`` method in the class
    hierarchy is ``object.__init__()``, which accepts no arguments. However,
    when the :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase` subclass is first declared, the
    class is given an ``__init__()`` method that links to the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.constructor` constructor function, if no
    ``__init__()`` method is already present; this is the usual declarative
    constructor that will assign keyword arguments as attributes on the
    instance, assuming those attributes are established at the class level
    (i.e. are mapped, or are linked to a descriptor). This constructor is
    **never accessed by a mapped class without being called explicitly via
    super()**, as mapped classes are themselves given an ``__init__()`` method
    directly which calls :paramref:`_orm.registry.constructor`, so in the
    default case works independently of what the base-most ``__init__()``
    method does.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0.1  :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase` has a default
       constructor that links to :paramref:`_orm.registry.constructor` by
       default, so that calls to ``super().__init__()`` can access this
       constructor. Previously, due to an implementation mistake, this default
       constructor was missing, and calling ``super().__init__()`` would invoke
       ``object.__init__()``.

    The :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase` subclass may also declare an explicit
    ``__init__()`` method which will replace the use of the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.constructor` function at this level::

        class Base(DeclarativeBase):
            def __init__(self, id=None):
                self.id = id

    Mapped classes still will not invoke this constructor implicitly; it
    remains only accessible by calling ``super().__init__()``::

        class MyClass(Base):
            def __init__(self, id=None, name=None):
                self.name = name
                super().__init__(id=id)

    Note that this is a different behavior from what functions like the legacy
    :func:`_orm.declarative_base` would do; the base created by those functions
    would always install :paramref:`_orm.registry.constructor` for
    ``__init__()``.
