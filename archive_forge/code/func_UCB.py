    """UCB acquisition function. Interesting points to note:
    1) We concat with the fixed points, because we are not optimizing wrt
       these. This is the Reward and Time, which we can't change. We want
       to find the best hyperparameters *given* the reward and time.
    2) We use m to get the mean and m1 to get the variance. If we already
       have trials running, then m1 contains this information. This reduces
       the variance at points currently running, even if we don't have
       their label.
