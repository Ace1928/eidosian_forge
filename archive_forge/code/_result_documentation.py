    Given random variables 'A' and 'B', compute the variance on the ratio Y = A/B. Denote the
    mean of the random variables as a = E[A] and b = E[B] while the variances are var_a = Var[A]
    and var_b = Var[B] and the covariance as Cov[A,B]. The following expression approximates the
    variance of Y

    Var[Y] \approx (a/b) ^2 * ( var_a /a^2 + var_b / b^2 - 2 * Cov[A,B]/(a*b) )

    We assume the covariance of A and B is negligible, resting on the assumption that A and B
    are independently measured. The expression above rests on the assumption that B is non-zero,
    an assumption which we expect to hold true in most cases, but makes no such assumptions
    about A. If we allow E[A] = 0, then calculating the expression above via numpy would complain
    about dividing by zero. Instead, we can re-write the above expression as

    Var[Y] \approx var_a /b^2 + (a^2 * var_b) / b^4

    where we have dropped the covariance term as noted above.
