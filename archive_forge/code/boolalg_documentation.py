Return the mapping that equates variables between two
        simplified boolean expressions if possible.

        By "simplified" we mean that a function has been denested
        and is either an And (or an Or) whose arguments are either
        symbols (x), negated symbols (Not(x)), or Or (or an And) whose
        arguments are only symbols or negated symbols. For example,
        ``And(x, Not(y), Or(w, Not(z)))``.

        Basic.match is not robust enough (see issue 4835) so this is
        a workaround that is valid for simplified boolean expressions
