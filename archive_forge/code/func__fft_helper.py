    Calculate windowed FFT, for internal use by
    cusignal.spectral_analysis.spectral._spectral_helper

    This is a helper function that does the main FFT calculation for
    `_spectral helper`. All input validation is performed there, and the
    data axis is assumed to be the last axis of x. It is not designed to
    be called externally. The windows are not averaged over; the result
    from each window is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        Array of FFT data
