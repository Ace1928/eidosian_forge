        Calculates all the elements needed for plotting a dendrogram.

        :param (ndarray) X: Matrix of observations as array of arrays
        :param (list) colorscale: Color scale for dendrogram tree clusters
        :param (function) distfun: Function to compute the pairwise distance
                                   from the observations
        :param (function) linkagefun: Function to compute the linkage matrix
                                      from the pairwise distances
        :param (list) hovertext: List of hovertext for constituent traces of dendrogram
        :rtype (tuple): Contains all the traces in the following order:
            (a) trace_list: List of Plotly trace objects for dendrogram tree
            (b) icoord: All X points of the dendrogram tree as array of arrays
                with length 4
            (c) dcoord: All Y points of the dendrogram tree as array of arrays
                with length 4
            (d) ordered_labels: leaf labels in the order they are going to
                appear on the plot
            (e) P['leaves']: left-to-right traversal of the leaves
