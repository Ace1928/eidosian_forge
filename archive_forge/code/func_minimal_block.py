    """For a transitive group, finds the block system generated by
        ``points``.

        Explanation
        ===========

        If a group ``G`` acts on a set ``S``, a nonempty subset ``B`` of ``S``
        is called a block under the action of ``G`` if for all ``g`` in ``G``
        we have ``gB = B`` (``g`` fixes ``B``) or ``gB`` and ``B`` have no
        common points (``g`` moves ``B`` entirely). ([1], p.23; [6]).

        The distinct translates ``gB`` of a block ``B`` for ``g`` in ``G``
        partition the set ``S`` and this set of translates is known as a block
        system. Moreover, we obviously have that all blocks in the partition
        have the same size, hence the block size divides ``|S|`` ([1], p.23).
        A ``G``-congruence is an equivalence relation ``~`` on the set ``S``
        such that ``a ~ b`` implies ``g(a) ~ g(b)`` for all ``g`` in ``G``.
        For a transitive group, the equivalence classes of a ``G``-congruence
        and the blocks of a block system are the same thing ([1], p.23).

        The algorithm below checks the group for transitivity, and then finds
        the ``G``-congruence generated by the pairs ``(p_0, p_1), (p_0, p_2),
        ..., (p_0,p_{k-1})`` which is the same as finding the maximal block
        system (i.e., the one with minimum block size) such that
        ``p_0, ..., p_{k-1}`` are in the same block ([1], p.83).

        It is an implementation of Atkinson's algorithm, as suggested in [1],
        and manipulates an equivalence relation on the set ``S`` using a
        union-find data structure. The running time is just above
        `O(|points||S|)`. ([1], pp. 83-87; [7]).

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import DihedralGroup
        >>> D = DihedralGroup(10)
        >>> D.minimal_block([0, 5])
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        >>> D.minimal_block([0, 1])
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
