def _zseries_der(zs):
    """Differentiate a z-series.

    The derivative is with respect to x, not z. This is achieved using the
    chain rule and the value of dx/dz given in the module notes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    zs : z-series
        The z-series to differentiate.

    Returns
    -------
    derivative : z-series
        The derivative

    Notes
    -----
    The zseries for x (ns) has been multiplied by two in order to avoid
    using floats that are incompatible with Decimal and likely other
    specialized scalar types. This scaling has been compensated by
    multiplying the value of zs by two also so that the two cancels in the
    division.
