        This test will fail for:
            period:
                since period isn't yet implemented in ``select_dtypes``
                and because it will need a custom value converter +
                tick formatter (as was done for x-axis plots)

            categorical:
                 because it will need a custom value converter +
                 tick formatter (also doesn't work for x-axis, as of now)

            datetime_mixed_tz:
                because of the way how pandas handles ``Series`` of
                ``datetime`` objects with different timezone,
                generally converting ``datetime`` objects in a tz-aware
                form could help with this problem
