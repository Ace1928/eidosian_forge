    Performs the Vigenere cipher encryption on plaintext ``msg``, and

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.crypto.crypto import encipher_vigenere, AZ
    >>> key = "encrypt"
    >>> msg = "meet me on monday"
    >>> encipher_vigenere(msg, key)

    Section 1 of the Kryptos sculpture at the CIA headquarters
    uses this cipher and also changes the order of the
    alphabet [2]_. Here is the first line of that section of
    the sculpture:

    >>> from sympy.crypto.crypto import decipher_vigenere, padded_key
    >>> alp = padded_key('KRYPTOS', AZ())
    >>> key = 'PALIMPSEST'
    >>> msg = 'EMUFPHZLRFAXYUSDJKZLDKRNSHGNFIVJ'
    >>> decipher_vigenere(msg, key, alp)
    'BETWEENSUBTLESHADINGANDTHEABSENC'

    Explanation
    ===========

    The Vigenere cipher is named after Blaise de Vigenere, a sixteenth
    century diplomat and cryptographer, by a historical accident.
    Vigenere actually invented a different and more complicated cipher.
    The so-called *Vigenere cipher* was actually invented
    by Giovan Batista Belaso in 1553.

    This cipher was used in the 1800's, for example, during the American
    Civil War. The Confederacy used a brass cipher disk to implement the
    Vigenere cipher (now on display in the NSA Museum in Fort
    Meade) [1]_.

    The Vigenere cipher is a generalization of the shift cipher.
    Whereas the shift cipher shifts each letter by the same amount
    (that amount being the key of the shift cipher) the Vigenere
    cipher shifts a letter by an amount determined by the key (which is
    a word or phrase known only to the sender and receiver).

    For example, if the key was a single letter, such as "C", then the
    so-called Vigenere cipher is actually a shift cipher with a
    shift of `2` (since "C" is the 2nd letter of the alphabet, if
    you start counting at `0`). If the key was a word with two
    letters, such as "CA", then the so-called Vigenere cipher will
    shift letters in even positions by `2` and letters in odd positions
    are left alone (shifted by `0`, since "A" is the 0th letter, if
    you start counting at `0`).


    ALGORITHM:

        INPUT:

            ``msg``: string of characters that appear in ``symbols``
            (the plaintext)

            ``key``: a string of characters that appear in ``symbols``
            (the secret key)

            ``symbols``: a string of letters defining the alphabet


        OUTPUT:

            ``ct``: string of characters (the ciphertext message)

        STEPS:
            0. Number the letters of the alphabet from 0, ..., N
            1. Compute from the string ``key`` a list ``L1`` of
               corresponding integers. Let ``n1 = len(L1)``.
            2. Compute from the string ``msg`` a list ``L2`` of
               corresponding integers. Let ``n2 = len(L2)``.
            3. Break ``L2`` up sequentially into sublists of size
               ``n1``; the last sublist may be smaller than ``n1``
            4. For each of these sublists ``L`` of ``L2``, compute a
               new list ``C`` given by ``C[i] = L[i] + L1[i] (mod N)``
               to the ``i``-th element in the sublist, for each ``i``.
            5. Assemble these lists ``C`` by concatenation into a new
               list of length ``n2``.
            6. Compute from the new list a string ``ct`` of
               corresponding letters.

    Once it is known that the key is, say, `n` characters long,
    frequency analysis can be applied to every `n`-th letter of
    the ciphertext to determine the plaintext. This method is
    called *Kasiski examination* (although it was first discovered
    by Babbage). If they key is as long as the message and is
    comprised of randomly selected characters -- a one-time pad -- the
    message is theoretically unbreakable.

    The cipher Vigenere actually discovered is an "auto-key" cipher
    described as follows.

    ALGORITHM:

        INPUT:

          ``key``: a string of letters (the secret key)

          ``msg``: string of letters (the plaintext message)

        OUTPUT:

          ``ct``: string of upper-case letters (the ciphertext message)

        STEPS:
            0. Number the letters of the alphabet from 0, ..., N
            1. Compute from the string ``msg`` a list ``L2`` of
               corresponding integers. Let ``n2 = len(L2)``.
            2. Let ``n1`` be the length of the key. Append to the
               string ``key`` the first ``n2 - n1`` characters of
               the plaintext message. Compute from this string (also of
               length ``n2``) a list ``L1`` of integers corresponding
               to the letter numbers in the first step.
            3. Compute a new list ``C`` given by
               ``C[i] = L1[i] + L2[i] (mod N)``.
            4. Compute from the new list a string ``ct`` of letters
               corresponding to the new integers.

    To decipher the auto-key ciphertext, the key is used to decipher
    the first ``n1`` characters and then those characters become the
    key to  decipher the next ``n1`` characters, etc...:

    >>> m = AZ('go navy, beat army! yes you can'); m
    'GONAVYBEATARMYYESYOUCAN'
    >>> key = AZ('gold bug'); n1 = len(key); n2 = len(m)
    >>> auto_key = key + m[:n2 - n1]; auto_key
    'GOLDBUGGONAVYBEATARMYYE'
    >>> ct = encipher_vigenere(m, auto_key); ct
    'MCYDWSHKOGAMKZCELYFGAYR'
    >>> n1 = len(key)
    >>> pt = []
    >>> while ct:
    ...     part, ct = ct[:n1], ct[n1:]
    ...     pt.append(decipher_vigenere(part, key))
    ...     key = pt[-1]
    ...
    >>> ''.join(pt) == m
    True
