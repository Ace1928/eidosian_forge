        Generate sequences of sample predictions from a model with a probability distribution head.

        Args:
            past_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_input_channels)`):
                Past values of the time series that serves as context in order to predict the target values.

        Return:
            [`SamplePatchTSMixerRegressionOutput`] where the outputs `sequences` tensor will have shape `(batch_size,
            number of samples, num_targets)`.
