def register_package(priority: int, tagger: Callable[[STORAGE], Optional[str]], deserializer: Callable[[STORAGE, str], Optional[STORAGE]]):
    """
    Registers callables for tagging and deserializing storage objects with an associated priority.
    Tagging associates a device with a storage object at save time while deserializing moves a
    storage object to an appropriate device at load time. :attr:`tagger` and :attr:`deserializer`
    are run in the order given by their :attr:`priority` until a tagger/deserializer returns a
    value that is not `None`.

    To override the deserialization behavior for a device in the global registry, one can register a
    tagger with a higher priority than the existing tagger.

    This function can also be used to register a tagger and deserializer for new devices.

    Args:
        priority: Indicates the priority associated with the tagger and deserializer, where a lower
            value indicates higher priority.
        tagger: Callable that takes in a storage object and returns its tagged device as a string
            or None.
        deserializer: Callable that takes in storage object and a device string and returns a storage
            object on the appropriate device or None.

    Returns:
        `None`

    Example:
        >>> def ipu_tag(obj):
        >>>     if obj.device.type == 'ipu':
        >>>         return 'ipu'
        >>> def ipu_deserialize(obj, location):
        >>>     if location.startswith('ipu'):
        >>>         ipu = getattr(torch, "ipu", None)
        >>>         assert ipu is not None, "IPU device module is not loaded"
        >>>         assert torch.ipu.is_available(), "ipu is not available"
        >>>         return obj.ipu(location)
        >>> torch.serialization.register_package(11, ipu_tag, ipu_deserialize)
