Representation of the operator as a product of other operators (static method).

        .. math:: O = O_1 O_2 \dots O_n.

        .. note::

            Operations making up the decomposition should be queued within the
            ``compute_decomposition`` method.

        .. seealso:: :meth:`~.Operator.decomposition`.

        Args:
            *params (list): trainable parameters of the operator, as stored in the ``parameters`` attribute
            wires (Iterable[Any], Wires): wires that the operator acts on
            **hyperparams (dict): non-trainable hyperparameters of the operator, as stored in the ``hyperparameters`` attribute

        Returns:
            list[Operator]: decomposition of the operator
