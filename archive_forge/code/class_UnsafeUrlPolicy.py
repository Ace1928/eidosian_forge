    The "unsafe-url" policy specifies that a full URL, stripped for use as a referrer,
    is sent along with both cross-origin requests
    and same-origin requests made from a particular request client.

    Note: The policy's name doesn't lie; it is unsafe.
    This policy will leak origins and paths from TLS-protected resources
    to insecure origins.
    Carefully consider the impact of setting such a policy for potentially sensitive documents.
