    When the parser is instantiated it is ready to begin accepting
    data from the feed method immediately. After parsing has been
    finished with a call to close the reset method must be called to
    make the parser ready to accept new data, either from feed or
    using the parse method.

    Note that these methods must _not_ be called during parsing, that
    is, after parse has been called and before it returns.

    By default, the class also implements the parse method of the XMLReader
    interface using the feed, close and reset methods of the
    IncrementalParser interface as a convenience to SAX 2.0 driver
    writers."""
