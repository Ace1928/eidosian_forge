    """Properties customizing the appearance and execution of a Gmail add-on.

  Fields:
    authorizationCheckFunction: The name of an endpoint that verifies that the
      add-on has all the required third-party authorizations, by probing the
      third-party APIs. If the probe fails, the function should throw an
      exception to initiate the authorization flow. This function is called
      before each invocation of the add-on in order to ensure a smooth user
      experience.
    composeTrigger: Defines the compose time trigger for a compose time add-
      on. This is the trigger that causes an add-on to take action when the
      user is composing an email. All compose time add-ons must have the
      `gmail.addons.current.action.compose` scope even though it might not
      edit the draft.
    contextualTriggers: Defines the set of conditions that trigger the add-on.
    homepageTrigger: Defines an endpoint that will be executed in contexts
      that don't match a declared contextual trigger. Any cards generated by
      this function will always be available to the user, but may be eclipsed
      by contextual content when this add-on declares more targeted triggers.
      If present, this overrides the configuration from
      `addOns.common.homepageTrigger`.
    universalActions: Defines a set of [universal actions](/gmail/add-ons/how-
      tos/universal-actions) for the add-on. The user triggers universal
      actions from the add-on toolbar menu.
