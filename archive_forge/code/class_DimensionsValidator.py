Must be an array of\n                `[fromValue, toValue]` with `fromValue <=\n                toValue`, or if `multiselect` is not disabled,\n                you may give an array of arrays, where each\n                inner array is `[fromValue, toValue]`.\n            label\n                The shown name of the dimension.\n            multiselect\n                Do we allow multiple selection ranges or just a\n                single range?\n            name\n                When used in a template, named items are\n                created in the output figure in addition to any\n                items the figure already has in this array. You\n                can modify these items in the output figure by\n                making your own item with `templateitemname`\n                matching this `name` alongside your\n                modifications (including `visible: false` or\n                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect\n                outside of a template.\n            range\n                The domain range that represents the full,\n                shown axis extent. Defaults to the `values`\n                extent. Must be an array of `[fromValue,\n                toValue]` with finite numbers as elements.\n            templateitemname\n                Used to refer to a named item in this array in\n                the template. Named items from the template\n                will be created even without a matching item in\n                the input figure, but you can modify one by\n                making an item with `templateitemname` matching\n                its `name`, alongside your modifications\n                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false`\n                to hide it). If there is no template or no\n                matching item, this item will be hidden unless\n                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`.\n            tickformat\n                Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3\n                formatting mini-languages which are very\n                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h\n                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-\n                format. And for dates see:\n                https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n                format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two\n                items to d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of\n                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"\n                for fractional seconds with n digits. For\n                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with\n                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display\n                "09~15~23.46"\n            ticktext\n                Sets the text displayed at the ticks position\n                via `tickvals`.\n            ticktextsrc\n                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud\n                for `ticktext`.\n            tickvals\n                Sets the values at which ticks on this axis\n                appear.\n            tickvalssrc\n                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud\n                for `tickvals`.\n            values\n                Dimension values. `values[n]` represents the\n                value of the `n`th point in the dataset,\n                therefore the `values` vector for all\n                dimensions must be the same (longer vectors\n                will be truncated). Each value must be a finite\n                number.\n            valuessrc\n                Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud\n                for `values`.\n            visible\n                Shows the dimension when set to `true` (the\n                default). Hides the dimension for `false`.\n'), **kwargs)
