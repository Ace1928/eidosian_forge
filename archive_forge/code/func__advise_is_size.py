    Don't use this directly; use torch._check_is_size instead.

    This is a softer version of _constrain_range_for_size (with min=0,
    max=Inf).  Instead of forcibly constraining a variable (and erroring if we
    failed to constrain it), it will simply advise us that a size is
    constrained in some way.  We will always defer a runtime assert for this
    constraint if we cannot prove it at compile-time, but we we only
    *sometimes* learn useful extra information at compile-time with this
    information.  This is in contrast to constrain_range_for_size, where if
    you don't call that on a fresh unbacked symint, chances are we will choke.

    TODO: Make Dynamo handle this appropriately if this is seen in Dynamo-ed
    code.  Right now this is only really used in code with AOTAutograd trace
    through, so it is not a big problem that this isn't supported, but in
    principle all of this code should be Dynamo'able too.

    TODO: I didn't support min/max because I didn't have a use case where this
    actually helped.  In principle we can support it, it just makes the
    implementation below more complicated.
