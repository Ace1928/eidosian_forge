    """This is intended to behave just like `__init_subclass__`, but is called by `ModelMetaclass`
        only after the class is actually fully initialized. In particular, attributes like `model_fields` will
        be present when this is called.

        This is necessary because `__init_subclass__` will always be called by `type.__new__`,
        and it would require a prohibitively large refactor to the `ModelMetaclass` to ensure that
        `type.__new__` was called in such a manner that the class would already be sufficiently initialized.

        This will receive the same `kwargs` that would be passed to the standard `__init_subclass__`, namely,
        any kwargs passed to the class definition that aren't used internally by pydantic.

        Args:
            **kwargs: Any keyword arguments passed to the class definition that aren't used internally
                by pydantic.
