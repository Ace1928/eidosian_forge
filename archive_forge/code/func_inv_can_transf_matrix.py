        Useless method, kept for compatibility with previous versions.

        DO NOT USE.

        Compute the inverse transformation matrix from the base to the
        canonical dimension basis.

        It corresponds to the matrix where columns are the vector of base
        dimensions in canonical basis.

        This matrix will almost never be used because dimensions are always
        defined with respect to the canonical basis, so no work has to be done
        to get them in this basis. Nonetheless if this matrix is not square
        (or not invertible) it means that we have chosen a bad basis.
