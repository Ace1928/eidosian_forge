  Fields:
    pubsubTopic: The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic
      that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
      The notification is a `PubsubMessage` with the following fields: *
      `PubsubMessage.Data` contains the resource name. *
      `PubsubMessage.MessageId` is the ID of this notification. It is
      guaranteed to be unique within the topic. * `PubsubMessage.PublishTime`
      is the time when the message was published. Note that notifications are
      only sent if the topic is non-empty. [Topic
      names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names) must be
      scoped to a project. The Cloud Healthcare API service account,
      service-@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com, must have publisher
      permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions
      causes the calls that send notifications to fail
      (https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/permissions-healthcare-
      api-gcp-products#dicom_fhir_and_hl7v2_store_cloud_pubsub_permissions).
      If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged to
      Cloud Logging. For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud
      Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/how-tos/logging).
    sendFullResource: Whether to send full FHIR resource to this Pub/Sub
      topic.
    sendPreviousResourceOnDelete: Whether to send full FHIR resource to this
      Pub/Sub topic for deleting FHIR resource. Note that setting this to true
      does not guarantee that all previous resources will be sent in the
      format of full FHIR resource. When a resource change is too large or
      during heavy traffic, only the resource name will be sent. Clients
      should always check the "payloadType" label from a Pub/Sub message to
      determine whether it needs to fetch the full previous resource as a
      separate operation.
