Finds the limit of a sequence as index ``n`` tends to infinity.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Expr
        SymPy expression for the ``n-th`` term of the sequence
    n : Symbol, optional
        The index of the sequence, an integer that tends to positive
        infinity. If None, inferred from the expression unless it has
        multiple symbols.
    trials: int, optional
        The algorithm is highly recursive. ``trials`` is a safeguard from
        infinite recursion in case the limit is not easily computed by the
        algorithm. Try increasing ``trials`` if the algorithm returns ``None``.

    Admissible Terms
    ================

    The algorithm is designed for sequences built from rational functions,
    indefinite sums, and indefinite products over an indeterminate n. Terms of
    alternating sign are also allowed, but more complex oscillatory behavior is
    not supported.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import limit_seq, Sum, binomial
    >>> from sympy.abc import n, k, m
    >>> limit_seq((5*n**3 + 3*n**2 + 4) / (3*n**3 + 4*n - 5), n)
    5/3
    >>> limit_seq(binomial(2*n, n) / Sum(binomial(2*k, k), (k, 1, n)), n)
    3/4
    >>> limit_seq(Sum(k**2 * Sum(2**m/m, (m, 1, k)), (k, 1, n)) / (2**n*n), n)
    4
