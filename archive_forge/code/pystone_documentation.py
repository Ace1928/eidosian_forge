"PYSTONE" Benchmark Program

Version:        Python/1.1 (corresponds to C/1.1 plus 2 Pystone fixes)

Author:         Reinhold P. Weicker,  CACM Vol 27, No 10, 10/84 pg. 1013.

                Translated from ADA to C by Rick Richardson.
                Every method to preserve ADA-likeness has been used,
                at the expense of C-ness.

                Translated from C to Python by Guido van Rossum.

Version History:

                Version 1.1 corrects two bugs in version 1.0:

                First, it leaked memory: in Proc1(), NextRecord ends
                up having a pointer to itself.  I have corrected this
                by zapping NextRecord.PtrComp at the end of Proc1().

                Second, Proc3() used the operator != to compare a
                record to None.  This is rather inefficient and not
                true to the intention of the original benchmark (where
                a pointer comparison to None is intended; the !=
                operator attempts to find a method __cmp__ to do value
                comparison of the record).  Version 1.1 runs 5-10
                percent faster than version 1.0, so benchmark figures
                of different versions can't be compared directly.
