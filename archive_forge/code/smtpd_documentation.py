Override this abstract method to handle messages from the client.

        peer is a tuple containing (ipaddr, port) of the client that made the
        socket connection to our smtp port.

        mailfrom is the raw address the client claims the message is coming
        from.

        rcpttos is a list of raw addresses the client wishes to deliver the
        message to.

        data is a string containing the entire full text of the message,
        headers (if supplied) and all.  It has been `de-transparencied'
        according to RFC 821, Section 4.5.2.  In other words, a line
        containing a `.' followed by other text has had the leading dot
        removed.

        kwargs is a dictionary containing additional information.  It is
        empty if decode_data=True was given as init parameter, otherwise
        it will contain the following keys:
            'mail_options': list of parameters to the mail command.  All
                            elements are uppercase strings.  Example:
                            ['BODY=8BITMIME', 'SMTPUTF8'].
            'rcpt_options': same, for the rcpt command.

        This function should return None for a normal `250 Ok' response;
        otherwise, it should return the desired response string in RFC 821
        format.
