def optimal_fft_length(window_length: int) -> int:
    """
    Finds the best FFT input size for a given `window_length`. This function takes a given window length and, if not
    already a power of two, rounds it up to the next power or two.

    The FFT algorithm works fastest when the length of the input is a power of two, which may be larger than the size
    of the window or analysis frame. For example, if the window is 400 samples, using an FFT input size of 512 samples
    is more optimal than an FFT size of 400 samples. Using a larger FFT size does not affect the detected frequencies,
    it simply gives a higher frequency resolution (i.e. the frequency bins are smaller).
