def convolve1d(input, weights, axis=-1, output=None, mode='reflect', cval=0.0, origin=0):
    """One-dimensional convolution.

    The array is convolved with the given kernel.

    Args:
        input (cupy.ndarray): The input array.
        weights (cupy.ndarray): One-dimensional array of weights
        axis (int): The axis of input along which to calculate. Default is -1.
        output (cupy.ndarray, dtype or None): The array in which to place the
            output. Default is is same dtype as the input.
        mode (str): The array borders are handled according to the given mode
            (``'reflect'``, ``'constant'``, ``'nearest'``, ``'mirror'``,
            ``'wrap'``). Default is ``'reflect'``.
        cval (scalar): Value to fill past edges of input if mode is
            ``'constant'``. Default is ``0.0``.
        origin (int): The origin parameter controls the placement of the
            filter, relative to the center of the current element of the
            input. Default is ``0``.
    Returns:
        cupy.ndarray: The result of the 1D convolution.

    .. note::
        When the output data type is integral (or when no output is provided
        and input is integral) the results may not perfectly match the results
        from SciPy due to floating-point rounding of intermediate results.
