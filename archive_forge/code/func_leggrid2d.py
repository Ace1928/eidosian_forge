def leggrid2d(x, y, c):
    """
    Evaluate a 2-D Legendre series on the Cartesian product of x and y.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * L_i(a) * L_j(b)

    where the points `(a, b)` consist of all pairs formed by taking
    `a` from `x` and `b` from `y`. The resulting points form a grid with
    `x` in the first dimension and `y` in the second.

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In either
    case, either `x` and `y` or their elements must support multiplication
    and addition both with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape + y.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.  If `x` or `y` is a list or
        tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term of
        multi-degree i,j is contained in `c[i,j]`. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional Chebyshev series at points in the
        Cartesian product of `x` and `y`.
