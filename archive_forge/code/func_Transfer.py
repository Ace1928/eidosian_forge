    """Deprecated: For more information, see [Cloud Domains feature deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/deprecations/feature-deprecations) Transfers a domain name from another registrar to Cloud Domains. For domains already managed by [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), use `ImportDomain` instead. Before calling this method, go to the domain's current registrar to unlock the domain for transfer and retrieve the domain's transfer authorization code. Then call `RetrieveTransferParameters` to confirm that the domain is unlocked and to get values needed to build a call to this method. A successful call creates a `Registration` resource in state `TRANSFER_PENDING`. It can take several days to complete the transfer process. The registrant can often speed up this process by approving the transfer through the current registrar, either by clicking a link in an email from the registrar or by visiting the registrar's website. A few minutes after transfer approval, the resource transitions to state `ACTIVE`, indicating that the transfer was successful. If the transfer is rejected or the request expires without being approved, the resource can end up in state `TRANSFER_FAILED`. If transfer fails, you can safely delete the resource and retry the transfer.

        request: (DomainsProjectsLocationsRegistrationsTransferRequest) input message
