    Class for outputs of [`TFDPRQuestionEncoder`].

    Args:
        pooler_output (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, embeddings_size)`):
            The DPR encoder outputs the *pooler_output* that corresponds to the question representation. Last layer
            hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token) further processed by a Linear layer.
            This output is to be used to embed questions for nearest neighbors queries with context embeddings.
        hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
