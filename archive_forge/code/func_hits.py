def hits(G, max_iter=100, tol=1e-08, nstart=None, normalized=True):
    """Returns HITS hubs and authorities values for nodes.

    The HITS algorithm computes two numbers for a node.
    Authorities estimates the node value based on the incoming links.
    Hubs estimates the node value based on outgoing links.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A NetworkX graph

    max_iter : integer, optional
      Maximum number of iterations in power method.

    tol : float, optional
      Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method iteration.

    nstart : dictionary, optional
      Starting value of each node for power method iteration.

    normalized : bool (default=True)
       Normalize results by the sum of all of the values.

    Returns
    -------
    (hubs,authorities) : two-tuple of dictionaries
       Two dictionaries keyed by node containing the hub and authority
       values.

    Raises
    ------
    PowerIterationFailedConvergence
        If the algorithm fails to converge to the specified tolerance
        within the specified number of iterations of the power iteration
        method.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> h, a = nx.hits(G)

    Notes
    -----
    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method
    and has no guarantee of convergence.  The iteration will stop
    after max_iter iterations or an error tolerance of
    number_of_nodes(G)*tol has been reached.

    The HITS algorithm was designed for directed graphs but this
    algorithm does not check if the input graph is directed and will
    execute on undirected graphs.
