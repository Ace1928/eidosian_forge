    Infers the types of an expression, annotating its AST accordingly.

    Example:
        >>> import sqlglot
        >>> schema = {"y": {"cola": "SMALLINT"}}
        >>> sql = "SELECT x.cola + 2.5 AS cola FROM (SELECT y.cola AS cola FROM y AS y) AS x"
        >>> annotated_expr = annotate_types(sqlglot.parse_one(sql), schema=schema)
        >>> annotated_expr.expressions[0].type.this  # Get the type of "x.cola + 2.5 AS cola"
        <Type.DOUBLE: 'DOUBLE'>

    Args:
        expression: Expression to annotate.
        schema: Database schema.
        annotators: Maps expression type to corresponding annotation function.
        coerces_to: Maps expression type to set of types that it can be coerced into.

    Returns:
        The expression annotated with types.
