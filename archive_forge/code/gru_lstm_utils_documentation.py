Register a specialization of a `Function` into the graph.

    This won't actually call the function with the inputs, and only put the
    function definition into graph. Register function with different input param
    will result into multiple version of functions registered in graph.

    Args:
      func: the `Function` instance that generated by a @defun
      *args: input arguments for the Python function.
      **kwargs: input keyword arguments for the Python function.

    Returns:
      a `ConcreteFunction` object specialized to inputs and execution context.

    Raises:
      ValueError: When the input function is not a defun wrapped python
        function.
