    """A RouterInterface object.

  Enums:
    IpVersionValueValuesEnum: IP version of this interface.
    ManagementTypeValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The resource that configures
      and manages this interface. - MANAGED_BY_USER is the default value and
      can be managed directly by users. - MANAGED_BY_ATTACHMENT is an
      interface that is configured and managed by Cloud Interconnect,
      specifically, by an InterconnectAttachment of type PARTNER. Google
      automatically creates, updates, and deletes this type of interface when
      the PARTNER InterconnectAttachment is created, updated, or deleted.

  Fields:
    ipRange: IP address and range of the interface. The IP range must be in
      the RFC3927 link-local IP address space. The value must be a CIDR-
      formatted string, for example: 169.254.0.1/30. NOTE: Do not truncate the
      address as it represents the IP address of the interface.
    ipVersion: IP version of this interface.
    linkedInterconnectAttachment: URI of the linked Interconnect attachment.
      It must be in the same region as the router. Each interface can have one
      linked resource, which can be a VPN tunnel, an Interconnect attachment,
      or a subnetwork.
    linkedVpnTunnel: URI of the linked VPN tunnel, which must be in the same
      region as the router. Each interface can have one linked resource, which
      can be a VPN tunnel, an Interconnect attachment, or a subnetwork.
    managementType: [Output Only] The resource that configures and manages
      this interface. - MANAGED_BY_USER is the default value and can be
      managed directly by users. - MANAGED_BY_ATTACHMENT is an interface that
      is configured and managed by Cloud Interconnect, specifically, by an
      InterconnectAttachment of type PARTNER. Google automatically creates,
      updates, and deletes this type of interface when the PARTNER
      InterconnectAttachment is created, updated, or deleted.
    name: Name of this interface entry. The name must be 1-63 characters long,
      and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
      means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    privateIpAddress: The regional private internal IP address that is used to
      establish BGP sessions to a VM instance acting as a third-party Router
      Appliance, such as a Next Gen Firewall, a Virtual Router, or an SD-WAN
      VM.
    redundantInterface: Name of the interface that will be redundant with the
      current interface you are creating. The redundantInterface must belong
      to the same Cloud Router as the interface here. To establish the BGP
      session to a Router Appliance VM, you must create two BGP peers. The two
      BGP peers must be attached to two separate interfaces that are redundant
      with each other. The redundant_interface must be 1-63 characters long,
      and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the redundant_interface must be
      1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a
      lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
      letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
    subnetwork: The URI of the subnetwork resource that this interface belongs
      to, which must be in the same region as the Cloud Router. When you
      establish a BGP session to a VM instance using this interface, the VM
      instance must belong to the same subnetwork as the subnetwork specified
      here.
