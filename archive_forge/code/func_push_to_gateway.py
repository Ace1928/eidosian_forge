def push_to_gateway(gateway: str, job: str, registry: CollectorRegistry, grouping_key: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]=None, timeout: Optional[float]=30, handler: Callable=default_handler) -> None:
    """Push metrics to the given pushgateway.

    `gateway` the url for your push gateway. Either of the form
              'http://pushgateway.local', or 'pushgateway.local'.
              Scheme defaults to 'http' if none is provided
    `job` is the job label to be attached to all pushed metrics
    `registry` is an instance of CollectorRegistry
    `grouping_key` please see the pushgateway documentation for details.
                   Defaults to None
    `timeout` is how long push will attempt to connect before giving up.
              Defaults to 30s, can be set to None for no timeout.
    `handler` is an optional function which can be provided to perform
              requests to the 'gateway'.
              Defaults to None, in which case an http or https request
              will be carried out by a default handler.
              If not None, the argument must be a function which accepts
              the following arguments:
              url, method, timeout, headers, and content
              May be used to implement additional functionality not
              supported by the built-in default handler (such as SSL
              client certicates, and HTTP authentication mechanisms).
              'url' is the URL for the request, the 'gateway' argument
              described earlier will form the basis of this URL.
              'method' is the HTTP method which should be used when
              carrying out the request.
              'timeout' requests not successfully completed after this
              many seconds should be aborted.  If timeout is None, then
              the handler should not set a timeout.
              'headers' is a list of ("header-name","header-value") tuples
              which must be passed to the pushgateway in the form of HTTP
              request headers.
              The function should raise an exception (e.g. IOError) on
              failure.
              'content' is the data which should be used to form the HTTP
              Message Body.

    This overwrites all metrics with the same job and grouping_key.
    This uses the PUT HTTP method."""
