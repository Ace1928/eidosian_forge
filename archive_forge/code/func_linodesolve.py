    System of n equations linear first-order differential equations

    Explanation
    ===========

    This solver solves the system of ODEs of the following form:

    .. math::
        X'(t) = A(t) X(t) +  b(t)

    Here, $A(t)$ is the coefficient matrix, $X(t)$ is the vector of n independent variables,
    $b(t)$ is the non-homogeneous term and $X'(t)$ is the derivative of $X(t)$

    Depending on the properties of $A(t)$ and $b(t)$, this solver evaluates the solution
    differently.

    When $A(t)$ is constant coefficient matrix and $b(t)$ is zero vector i.e. system is homogeneous,
    the system is "type1". The solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) = \\exp(A t) C

    Here, $C$ is a vector of constants and $A$ is the constant coefficient matrix.

    When $A(t)$ is constant coefficient matrix and $b(t)$ is non-zero i.e. system is non-homogeneous,
    the system is "type2". The solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) = e^{A t} ( \\int e^{- A t} b \\,dt + C)

    When $A(t)$ is coefficient matrix such that its commutative with its antiderivative $B(t)$ and
    $b(t)$ is a zero vector i.e. system is homogeneous, the system is "type3". The solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) = \\exp(B(t)) C

    When $A(t)$ is commutative with its antiderivative $B(t)$ and $b(t)$ is non-zero i.e. system is
    non-homogeneous, the system is "type4". The solution is:

    .. math::
        X(t) =  e^{B(t)} ( \\int e^{-B(t)} b(t) \\,dt + C)

    When $A(t)$ is a coefficient matrix such that it can be factorized into a scalar and a constant
    coefficient matrix:

    .. math::
        A(t) = f(t) * A

    Where $f(t)$ is a scalar expression in the independent variable $t$ and $A$ is a constant matrix,
    then we can do the following substitutions:

    .. math::
        tau = \\int f(t) dt, X(t) = Y(tau), b(t) = b(f^{-1}(tau))

    Here, the substitution for the non-homogeneous term is done only when its non-zero.
    Using these substitutions, our original system becomes:

    .. math::
        Y'(tau) = A * Y(tau) + b(tau)/f(tau)

    The above system can be easily solved using the solution for "type1" or "type2" depending
    on the homogeneity of the system. After we get the solution for $Y(tau)$, we substitute the
    solution for $tau$ as $t$ to get back $X(t)$

    .. math::
        X(t) = Y(tau)

    Systems of "type5" and "type6" have a commutative antiderivative but we use this solution
    because its faster to compute.

    The final solution is the general solution for all the four equations since a constant coefficient
    matrix is always commutative with its antidervative.

    An additional feature of this function is, if someone wants to substitute for value of the independent
    variable, they can pass the substitution `tau` and the solution will have the independent variable
    substituted with the passed expression(`tau`).

    Parameters
    ==========

    A : Matrix
        Coefficient matrix of the system of linear first order ODEs.
    t : Symbol
        Independent variable in the system of ODEs.
    b : Matrix or None
        Non-homogeneous term in the system of ODEs. If None is passed,
        a homogeneous system of ODEs is assumed.
    B : Matrix or None
        Antiderivative of the coefficient matrix. If the antiderivative
        is not passed and the solution requires the term, then the solver
        would compute it internally.
    type : String
        Type of the system of ODEs passed. Depending on the type, the
        solution is evaluated. The type values allowed and the corresponding
        system it solves are: "type1" for constant coefficient homogeneous
        "type2" for constant coefficient non-homogeneous, "type3" for non-constant
        coefficient homogeneous, "type4" for non-constant coefficient non-homogeneous,
        "type5" and "type6" for non-constant coefficient homogeneous and non-homogeneous
        systems respectively where the coefficient matrix can be factorized to a constant
        coefficient matrix.
        The default value is "auto" which will let the solver decide the correct type of
        the system passed.
    doit : Boolean
        Evaluate the solution if True, default value is False
    tau: Expression
        Used to substitute for the value of `t` after we get the solution of the system.

    Examples
    ========

    To solve the system of ODEs using this function directly, several things must be
    done in the right order. Wrong inputs to the function will lead to incorrect results.

    >>> from sympy import symbols, Function, Eq
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import canonical_odes, linear_ode_to_matrix, linodesolve, linodesolve_type
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.subscheck import checkodesol
    >>> f, g = symbols("f, g", cls=Function)
    >>> x, a = symbols("x, a")
    >>> funcs = [f(x), g(x)]
    >>> eqs = [Eq(f(x).diff(x) - f(x), a*g(x) + 1), Eq(g(x).diff(x) + g(x), a*f(x))]

    Here, it is important to note that before we derive the coefficient matrix, it is
    important to get the system of ODEs into the desired form. For that we will use
    :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.canonical_odes()`.

    >>> eqs = canonical_odes(eqs, funcs, x)
    >>> eqs
    [[Eq(Derivative(f(x), x), a*g(x) + f(x) + 1), Eq(Derivative(g(x), x), a*f(x) - g(x))]]

    Now, we will use :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linear_ode_to_matrix()` to get the coefficient matrix and the
    non-homogeneous term if it is there.

    >>> eqs = eqs[0]
    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, x, 1)
    >>> A = A0

    We have the coefficient matrices and the non-homogeneous term ready. Now, we can use
    :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve_type()` to get the information for the system of ODEs
    to finally pass it to the solver.

    >>> system_info = linodesolve_type(A, x, b=b)
    >>> sol_vector = linodesolve(A, x, b=b, B=system_info['antiderivative'], type=system_info['type_of_equation'])

    Now, we can prove if the solution is correct or not by using :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.checkodesol()`

    >>> sol = [Eq(f, s) for f, s in zip(funcs, sol_vector)]
    >>> checkodesol(eqs, sol)
    (True, [0, 0])

    We can also use the doit method to evaluate the solutions passed by the function.

    >>> sol_vector_evaluated = linodesolve(A, x, b=b, type="type2", doit=True)

    Now, we will look at a system of ODEs which is non-constant.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(f(x).diff(x), f(x) + x*g(x)), Eq(g(x).diff(x), -x*f(x) + g(x))]

    The system defined above is already in the desired form, so we do not have to convert it.

    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, x, 1)
    >>> A = A0

    A user can also pass the commutative antiderivative required for type3 and type4 system of ODEs.
    Passing an incorrect one will lead to incorrect results. If the coefficient matrix is not commutative
    with its antiderivative, then :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve_type()` raises a NotImplementedError.
    If it does have a commutative antiderivative, then the function just returns the information about the system.

    >>> system_info = linodesolve_type(A, x, b=b)

    Now, we can pass the antiderivative as an argument to get the solution. If the system information is not
    passed, then the solver will compute the required arguments internally.

    >>> sol_vector = linodesolve(A, x, b=b)

    Once again, we can verify the solution obtained.

    >>> sol = [Eq(f, s) for f, s in zip(funcs, sol_vector)]
    >>> checkodesol(eqs, sol)
    (True, [0, 0])

    Returns
    =======

    List

    Raises
    ======

    ValueError
        This error is raised when the coefficient matrix, non-homogeneous term
        or the antiderivative, if passed, are not a matrix or
        do not have correct dimensions
    NonSquareMatrixError
        When the coefficient matrix or its antiderivative, if passed is not a
        square matrix
    NotImplementedError
        If the coefficient matrix does not have a commutative antiderivative
