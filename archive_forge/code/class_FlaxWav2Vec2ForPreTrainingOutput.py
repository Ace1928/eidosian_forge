    Output type of [`FlaxWav2Vec2ForPreTrainingOutput`], with potential hidden states and attentions.

    Args:
        loss (*optional*, returned when model is in train mode, `jnp.ndarray` of shape `(1,)`):
            Total loss as the sum of the contrastive loss (L_m) and the diversity loss (L_d) as stated in the [official
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11477.pdf) . (classification) loss.
        projected_states (`jnp.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.proj_codevector_dim)`):
            Hidden-states of the model projected to *config.proj_codevector_dim* that can be used to predict the masked
            projected quantized states.
        projected_quantized_states (`jnp.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.proj_codevector_dim)`):
            Quantized extracted feature vectors projected to *config.proj_codevector_dim* representing the positive
            target vectors for contrastive loss.
        hidden_states (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
