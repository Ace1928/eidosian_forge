Return the number of loops and time taken so that total time >= 0.2.

        Calls the timeit method with increasing numbers from the sequence
        1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, ... until the time taken is at least 0.2
        second.  Returns (number, time_taken).

        If *callback* is given and is not None, it will be called after
        each trial with two arguments: ``callback(number, time_taken)``.
