def best_method_str(device, interface):
    """Similar to :meth:`~.get_best_method`, except return the
        'best' differentiation method in human-readable format.

        This method attempts to determine support for differentiation
        methods using the following order:

        * ``"device"``
        * ``"backprop"``
        * ``"parameter-shift"``
        * ``"finite-diff"``

        The first differentiation method that is supported (going from
        top to bottom) will be returned. Note that the SPSA-based and Hadamard-based gradient
        are not included here.

        This method is intended only for debugging purposes. Otherwise,
        :meth:`~.get_best_method` should be used instead.

        Args:
            device (.Device): PennyLane device
            interface (str): name of the requested interface

        Returns:
            str: The gradient function to use in human-readable format.
