    Used for the usage of set() and list().
    This is definitely a hack, but a good one :-)
    It makes it possible to use set/list conversions.

    This is not a proper context, because it doesn't have to be. It's not used
    in the wild, it's just used within typeshed as an argument to `__init__`
    for set/list and never used in any other place.
