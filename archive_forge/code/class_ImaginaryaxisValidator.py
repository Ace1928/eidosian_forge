Grid color is lightened by\n                blending this with the plot background\n                Individual pieces can override this.\n            gridcolor\n                Sets the color of the grid lines.\n            griddash\n                Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash\n                type string ("solid", "dot", "dash",\n                "longdash", "dashdot", or "longdashdot") or a\n                dash length list in px (eg "5px,10px,2px,2px").\n            gridwidth\n                Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n            hoverformat\n                Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3\n                formatting mini-languages which are very\n                similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h\n                ttps://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-\n                format.

We add two\n                items to d3\'s date formatter: "%h" for half of\n                the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"\n                for fractional seconds with n digits. For\n                example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with\n                tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display\n                "09~15~23.46"\n            labelalias\n                Replacement text for specific tick or hover\n                labels. For example using {US: \'USA\', CA:\n                \'Canada\'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.\n                The labels we would have shown must match the\n                keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or\n                ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign\n                symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular\n                ascii dash. That means you need to use −1\n                instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any\n                axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values\n                (if desired) can include html-like tags or\n                MathJax.\n            layer\n                Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed.\n                If *above traces*, this axis is displayed above\n                all the subplot\'s traces If *below traces*,\n                this axis is displayed below all the subplot\'s\n                traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when\n                used together with scatter-like traces with\n                `cliponaxis` set to False to show markers\n                and/or text nodes above this axis.\n            linecolor\n                Sets the axis line color.\n            linewidth\n                Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n            showgrid\n                Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn.\n                If True, the grid lines are drawn at every tick\n                mark.\n            showline\n                Determines whether or not a line bounding this\n                axis is drawn.\n            showticklabels\n                Determines whether or not the tick labels are\n                drawn.\n            showtickprefix\n                If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a\n                prefix. If "first", only the first tick is\n                displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the\n                last tick is displayed with a suffix. If\n                "none", tick prefixes are hidden.\n            showticksuffix\n                Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n            tickcolor\n                Sets the tick color.\n            tickfont\n                Sets the tick font.\n            tickformat\n                Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3\n                formatting mini-languages which are very\n                similar to those in Python.
