        Given the lines of a source string (including prompts and
        leading indentation), check to make sure that every prompt is
        followed by a space character.  If any line is not followed by
        a space character, then raise ValueError.

        Note: IPython-modified version which takes the input prompt length as a
        parameter, so that prompts of variable length can be dealt with.
