    """Fanout exchange.

    The `fanout` exchange implements broadcast messaging by delivering
    copies of all messages to all queues bound to the exchange.

    To support fanout the virtual channel needs to store the table
    as shared state.  This requires that the `Channel.supports_fanout`
    attribute is set to true, and the `Channel._queue_bind` and
    `Channel.get_table` methods are implemented.

    See Also
    --------
        the redis backend for an example implementation of these methods.
