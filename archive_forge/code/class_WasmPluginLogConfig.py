    """Specifies the logging options for the activity performed by this
  `WasmPlugin`. If logging is enabled, plugin logs are exported to Cloud
  Logging.

  Enums:
    MinLogLevelValueValuesEnum: Non-empty default. Specificies the lowest
      level of the plugin logs that are exported to Cloud Logging. This
      setting relates to the logs generated by using logging statements in
      your Wasm code. This field is can be set only if logging is enabled for
      the `WasmPlugin` resource. If the field is not provided when logging is
      enabled, it is set to `INFO` by default.

  Fields:
    enable: Optional. Specifies whether to enable logging for activity by this
      `WasmPlugin`. Defaults to `false`.
    minLogLevel: Non-empty default. Specificies the lowest level of the plugin
      logs that are exported to Cloud Logging. This setting relates to the
      logs generated by using logging statements in your Wasm code. This field
      is can be set only if logging is enabled for the `WasmPlugin` resource.
      If the field is not provided when logging is enabled, it is set to
      `INFO` by default.
    sampleRate: Non-empty default. Configures the sampling rate of activity
      logs, where `1.0` means all logged activity is reported and `0.0` means
      no activity is reported. The default value is `1.0`, and the value of
      the field must be between `0` and `1` (inclusive). The setting relates
      to logs generated in your Wasm code. Note that for the logs generated on
      the HTTP processing path, the sample rate is multiplied by the sample
      rate configured in the Media CDN service using this Wasm plugin. For
      example: - 0.5 of HTTP requests are logged because of the setting on the
      Media CDN service - Among those requests, 0.5 of logs are exported due
      to the setting on the Wasm plugin - In effect, 0.25 of logs on HTTP
      processing path are exported This field can only be specified if logging
      is enabled for this `WasmPlugin`. If the field is not provided when
      logging is enabled it is set to `1` by default.
