Partially unroll benchmark loop.

            The naive template looks something like:
                "for _ in range({number}): {stmt}"

            However a loop in Python is surprisingly expensive, and significantly
            increases the number of background Python instructions. So instead we
            partially unroll the loops, with a block size of 100 chosen to keep
            the instruction overhead from `range` low while also not ballooning
            the size of the generated file.
