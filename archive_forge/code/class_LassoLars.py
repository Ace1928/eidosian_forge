class LassoLars(Lars):
    """Lasso model fit with Least Angle Regression a.k.a. Lars.

    It is a Linear Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer.

    The optimization objective for Lasso is::

    (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <least_angle_regression>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, default=1.0
        Constant that multiplies the penalty term. Defaults to 1.0.
        ``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved
        by :class:`LinearRegression`. For numerical reasons, using
        ``alpha = 0`` with the LassoLars object is not advised and you
        should prefer the LinearRegression object.

    fit_intercept : bool, default=True
        Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (i.e. data is expected to be centered).

    verbose : bool or int, default=False
        Sets the verbosity amount.

    precompute : bool, 'auto' or array-like, default='auto'
        Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up
        calculations. If set to ``'auto'`` let us decide. The Gram
        matrix can also be passed as argument.

    max_iter : int, default=500
        Maximum number of iterations to perform.

    eps : float, default=np.finfo(float).eps
        The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the
        Cholesky diagonal factors. Increase this for very ill-conditioned
        systems. Unlike the ``tol`` parameter in some iterative
        optimization-based algorithms, this parameter does not control
        the tolerance of the optimization.

    copy_X : bool, default=True
        If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    fit_path : bool, default=True
        If ``True`` the full path is stored in the ``coef_path_`` attribute.
        If you compute the solution for a large problem or many targets,
        setting ``fit_path`` to ``False`` will lead to a speedup, especially
        with a small alpha.

    positive : bool, default=False
        Restrict coefficients to be >= 0. Be aware that you might want to
        remove fit_intercept which is set True by default.
        Under the positive restriction the model coefficients will not converge
        to the ordinary-least-squares solution for small values of alpha.
        Only coefficients up to the smallest alpha value (``alphas_[alphas_ >
        0.].min()`` when fit_path=True) reached by the stepwise Lars-Lasso
        algorithm are typically in congruence with the solution of the
        coordinate descent Lasso estimator.

    jitter : float, default=None
        Upper bound on a uniform noise parameter to be added to the
        `y` values, to satisfy the model's assumption of
        one-at-a-time computations. Might help with stability.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for jittering. Pass an int
        for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`. Ignored if `jitter` is None.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23

    Attributes
    ----------
    alphas_ : array-like of shape (n_alphas + 1,) or list of such arrays
        Maximum of covariances (in absolute value) at each iteration.
        ``n_alphas`` is either ``max_iter``, ``n_features`` or the
        number of nodes in the path with ``alpha >= alpha_min``, whichever
        is smaller. If this is a list of array-like, the length of the outer
        list is `n_targets`.

    active_ : list of length n_alphas or list of such lists
        Indices of active variables at the end of the path.
        If this is a list of list, the length of the outer list is `n_targets`.

    coef_path_ : array-like of shape (n_features, n_alphas + 1) or list             of such arrays
        If a list is passed it's expected to be one of n_targets such arrays.
        The varying values of the coefficients along the path. It is not
        present if the ``fit_path`` parameter is ``False``. If this is a list
        of array-like, the length of the outer list is `n_targets`.

    coef_ : array-like of shape (n_features,) or (n_targets, n_features)
        Parameter vector (w in the formulation formula).

    intercept_ : float or array-like of shape (n_targets,)
        Independent term in decision function.

    n_iter_ : array-like or int
        The number of iterations taken by lars_path to find the
        grid of alphas for each target.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.
