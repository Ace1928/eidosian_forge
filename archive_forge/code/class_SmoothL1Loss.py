class SmoothL1Loss(_Loss):
    """Creates a criterion that uses a squared term if the absolute
    element-wise error falls below beta and an L1 term otherwise.
    It is less sensitive to outliers than :class:`torch.nn.MSELoss` and in some cases
    prevents exploding gradients (e.g. see the paper `Fast R-CNN`_ by Ross Girshick).

    For a batch of size :math:`N`, the unreduced loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \\ell(x, y) = L = \\{l_1, ..., l_N\\}^T

    with

    .. math::
        l_n = \\begin{cases}
        0.5 (x_n - y_n)^2 / beta, & \\text{if } |x_n - y_n| < beta \\\\
        |x_n - y_n| - 0.5 * beta, & \\text{otherwise }
        \\end{cases}

    If `reduction` is not `none`, then:

    .. math::
        \\ell(x, y) =
        \\begin{cases}
            \\operatorname{mean}(L), &  \\text{if reduction} = \\text{`mean';}\\\\
            \\operatorname{sum}(L),  &  \\text{if reduction} = \\text{`sum'.}
        \\end{cases}

    .. note::
        Smooth L1 loss can be seen as exactly :class:`L1Loss`, but with the :math:`|x - y| < beta`
        portion replaced with a quadratic function such that its slope is 1 at :math:`|x - y| = beta`.
        The quadratic segment smooths the L1 loss near :math:`|x - y| = 0`.

    .. note::
        Smooth L1 loss is closely related to :class:`HuberLoss`, being
        equivalent to :math:`huber(x, y) / beta` (note that Smooth L1's beta hyper-parameter is
        also known as delta for Huber). This leads to the following differences:

        * As beta -> 0, Smooth L1 loss converges to :class:`L1Loss`, while :class:`HuberLoss`
          converges to a constant 0 loss. When beta is 0, Smooth L1 loss is equivalent to L1 loss.
        * As beta -> :math:`+\\infty`, Smooth L1 loss converges to a constant 0 loss, while
          :class:`HuberLoss` converges to :class:`MSELoss`.
        * For Smooth L1 loss, as beta varies, the L1 segment of the loss has a constant slope of 1.
          For :class:`HuberLoss`, the slope of the L1 segment is beta.

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        beta (float, optional): Specifies the threshold at which to change between L1 and L2 loss.
            The value must be non-negative. Default: 1.0

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`, where :math:`*` means any number of dimensions.
        - Target: :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input.
