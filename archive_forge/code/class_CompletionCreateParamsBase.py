Mathematically, the\n    bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact\n    effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or\n    increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban\n    or exclusive selection of the relevant token.\n    '

Without this, the model may\n    generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token\n    limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that\n    the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which\n    indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the\n    max context length.\n    '
