    """Returns ``RunStatistics``, which contains run-loop-level debugging information.

        Currently, the following fields are defined:

        * ``tasks_living`` (int): The number of tasks that have been spawned
          and not yet exited.
        * ``tasks_runnable`` (int): The number of tasks that are currently
          queued on the run queue (as opposed to blocked waiting for something
          to happen).
        * ``seconds_to_next_deadline`` (float): The time until the next
          pending cancel scope deadline. May be negative if the deadline has
          expired but we haven't yet processed cancellations. May be
          :data:`~math.inf` if there are no pending deadlines.
        * ``run_sync_soon_queue_size`` (int): The number of
          unprocessed callbacks queued via
          :meth:`trio.lowlevel.TrioToken.run_sync_soon`.
        * ``io_statistics`` (object): Some statistics from Trio's I/O
          backend. This always has an attribute ``backend`` which is a string
          naming which operating-system-specific I/O backend is in use; the
          other attributes vary between backends.
