    """App Engine HTTP request. The message defines the HTTP request that is
  sent to an App Engine app when the task is dispatched. Using
  AppEngineHttpRequest requires [`appengine.applications.get`](https://cloud.g
  oogle.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/access-control) Google IAM permission for
  the project and the following scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-
  platform` The task will be delivered to the App Engine app which belongs to
  the same project as the queue. For more information, see [How Requests are
  Routed](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/how-
  requests-are-routed) and how routing is affected by [dispatch
  files](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/dispatchref).
  Traffic is encrypted during transport and never leaves Google datacenters.
  Because this traffic is carried over a communication mechanism internal to
  Google, you cannot explicitly set the protocol (for example, HTTP or HTTPS).
  The request to the handler, however, will appear to have used the HTTP
  protocol. The AppEngineRouting used to construct the URL that the task is
  delivered to can be set at the queue-level or task-level: * If
  app_engine_routing_override is set on the queue, this value is used for all
  tasks in the queue, no matter what the setting is for the task-level
  app_engine_routing. The `url` that the task will be sent to is: * `url =`
  host `+` relative_uri Tasks can be dispatched to secure app handlers,
  unsecure app handlers, and URIs restricted with [`login: admin`](https://clo
  ud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). Because tasks
  are not run as any user, they cannot be dispatched to URIs restricted with
  [`login: required`](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/
  config/appref) Task dispatches also do not follow redirects. The task
  attempt has succeeded if the app's request handler returns an HTTP response
  code in the range [`200` - `299`]. The task attempt has failed if the app's
  handler returns a non-2xx response code or Cloud Tasks does not receive
  response before the deadline. Failed tasks will be retried according to the
  retry configuration. `503` (Service Unavailable) is considered an App Engine
  system error instead of an application error and will cause Cloud Tasks'
  traffic congestion control to temporarily throttle the queue's dispatches.
  Unlike other types of task targets, a `429` (Too Many Requests) response
  from an app handler does not cause traffic congestion control to throttle
  the queue.

  Enums:
    HttpMethodValueValuesEnum: The HTTP method to use for the request. The
      default is POST. The app's request handler for the task's target URL
      must be able to handle HTTP requests with this http_method, otherwise
      the task attempt fails with error code 405 (Method Not Allowed). See
      [Writing a push task request handler](https://cloud.google.com/appengine
      /docs/java/taskqueue/push/creating-
      handlers#writing_a_push_task_request_handler) and the App Engine
      documentation for your runtime on [How Requests are
      Handled](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/how-
      requests-are-handled).

  Messages:
    HeadersValue: HTTP request headers. This map contains the header field
      names and values. Headers can be set when the task is created. Repeated
      headers are not supported but a header value can contain commas. Cloud
      Tasks sets some headers to default values: * `User-Agent`: By default,
      this header is `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`. This header can be modified, but
      Cloud Tasks will append `"AppEngine-Google;
      (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. If
      the task has a body, Cloud Tasks sets the following headers: * `Content-
      Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to
      `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by
      explicitly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the
      task is created. For example, `Content-Type` can be set to
      `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud
      Tasks. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers
      below cannot be set or overridden: * `Host` * `X-Google-*` *
      `X-AppEngine-*` In addition, Cloud Tasks sets some headers when the task
      is dispatched, such as headers containing information about the task;
      see [request headers](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-
      appengine-handlers#reading_request_headers). These headers are set only
      when the task is dispatched, so they are not visible when the task is
      returned in a Cloud Tasks response. Although there is no specific limit
      for the maximum number of headers or the size, there is a limit on the
      maximum size of the Task. For more information, see the CreateTask
      documentation.

  Fields:
    appEngineRouting: Task-level setting for App Engine routing. * If

      app_engine_routing.

      requests-are-handled).
    relativeUri: The relative URI. The relative URI must begin with "/" and
      must be a valid HTTP relative URI. It can contain a path and query
      string arguments. If the relative URI is empty, then the root path "/"
      will be used. No spaces are allowed, and the maximum length allowed is
      2083 characters.
