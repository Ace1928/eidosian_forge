def polygrid3d(x, y, z, c):
    """
    Evaluate a 3-D polynomial on the Cartesian product of x, y and z.

    This function returns the values:

    .. math:: p(a,b,c) = \\sum_{i,j,k} c_{i,j,k} * a^i * b^j * c^k

    where the points `(a, b, c)` consist of all triples formed by taking
    `a` from `x`, `b` from `y`, and `c` from `z`. The resulting points form
    a grid with `x` in the first dimension, `y` in the second, and `z` in
    the third.

    The parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` are converted to arrays only if they
    are tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars. In
    either case, either `x`, `y`, and `z` or their elements must support
    multiplication and addition both with themselves and with the elements
    of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than three dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 3-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[3:] +
    x.shape + y.shape + z.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y, z : array_like, compatible objects
        The three dimensional series is evaluated at the points in the
        Cartesian product of `x`, `y`, and `z`.  If `x`,`y`, or `z` is a
        list or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is
        left unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a
        scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree i,j are contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has dimension
        greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple sets of
        coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points in the Cartesian
        product of `x` and `y`.
