def update_intermediates(base, keys, bound, s, fn, args, instance, value):
    """ Function that is called when an intermediate property is updated
    and `rebind` of that property is True. In that case, we unbind
    all bound funcs that were bound to attrs of the old value of the
    property and rebind them to the new value of the property.

    For example, if the rule is `self.a.b.c.d`, then when b is changed, we
    unbind from `b`, `c` and `d`, if they were bound before (they were not
    None and `rebind` of the respective properties was True) and we rebind
    to the new values of the attrs `b`, `c``, `d` that are not None and
    `rebind` is True.

    :Parameters:
        `base`
            A (proxied) ref to the base widget, `self` in the example
            above.
        `keys`
            A list of the name off the attrs of `base` being watched. In
            the example above it'd be `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.
        `bound`
            A list 4-tuples, each tuple being (widget, attr, callback, uid)
            representing callback functions bound to the attributed `attr`
            of `widget`. `uid` is returned by `fbind` when binding.
            The callback may be None, in which case the attr
            was not bound, but is there to be able to walk the attr tree.
            E.g. in the example above, if `b` was not an eventdispatcher,
            `(_b_ref_, `c`, None)` would be added to the list so we can get
            to `c` and `d`, which may be eventdispatchers and their attrs.
        `s`
            The index in `keys` of the of the attr that needs to be
            updated. That is all the keys from `s` and further will be
            rebound, since the `s` key was changed. In bound, the
            corresponding index is `s - 1`. If `s` is None, we start from
            1 (first attr).
        `fn`
            The function to be called args, `args` on bound callback.
