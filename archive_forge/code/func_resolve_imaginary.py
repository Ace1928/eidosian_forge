    Given a datetime that may be imaginary, return an existing datetime.

    This function assumes that an imaginary datetime represents what the
    wall time would be in a zone had the offset transition not occurred, so
    it will always fall forward by the transition's change in offset.

        >>> from dateutil import tz
        >>> from datetime import datetime
        >>> NYC = tz.gettz('America/New_York')
        >>> print(tz.resolve_imaginary(datetime(2017, 3, 12, 2, 30, tzinfo=NYC)))

    As a note, :func:`datetime.astimezone` is guaranteed to produce a valid,
    existing datetime, so a round-trip to and from UTC is sufficient to get
    an extant datetime, however, this generally "falls back" to an earlier time
    rather than falling forward to the STD side (though no guarantees are made
    about this behavior).

    :param dt:
        A :class:`datetime.datetime` which may or may not exist.

    :return:
        Returns an existing :class:`datetime.datetime`. If ``dt`` was not
        imaginary, the datetime returned is guaranteed to be the same object
        passed to the function.
