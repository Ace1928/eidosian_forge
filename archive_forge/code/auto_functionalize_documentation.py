Functionalizes a call to op(*args, **kwargs) by emitting a call to
    `outs = auto_functionalized(op, mutated_args_names, normalized_kwargs)`
    and replacing the mutated (args, kwargs) with the corresponding outputs.

    The normalized_kwargs are just the (args, kwargs), but all in kwarg form.
    This makes handling easier for the auto_functionalized HOP.
