    The message argument can also be list of strings, in which case any valid
    keyboard name can be used.

    Since this performs a sequence of keyboard presses and does not hold down
    keys, it cannot be used to perform keyboard shortcuts. Use the hotkey()
    function for that.

    Args:
      message (str, list): If a string, then the characters to be pressed. If a
        list, then the key names of the keys to press in order. The valid names
        are listed in KEYBOARD_KEYS.
      interval (float, optional): The number of seconds in between each press.
        0.0 by default, for no pause in between presses.
