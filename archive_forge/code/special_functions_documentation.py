Stacks the input, if it admits the notion of stacking.

  For example, a list of tensors can be stacked into a larger tensor. This
  function is similar to tf.stack, but it accepts non-lists and lists of
  non-tensors as arguments. In the latter case, the function does nothing.

  Args:
    list_or_tensor: Any
    element_dtype: tf.DType, optional dtypedtype for the elements in the list.
        Required if the input is stackable, and the list is untyped.
    strict: bool, if True an error is raised if the input is not stackable.
        Otherwise the function is a no-op.

  Returns:
    Any, if the input is stackable, the result will be a tf.Tensor. Otherwise,
    if strict=False, the result will be list_or_tensor.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if strict=True and the input is not stackable.
