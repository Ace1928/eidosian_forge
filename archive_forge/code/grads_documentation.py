Compute each parameter's gradient's norm and their overall norm.

    The overall norm is computed over all gradients together, as if they
    were concatenated into a single vector.

    Args:
        module: :class:`torch.nn.Module` to inspect.
        norm_type: The type of the used p-norm, cast to float if necessary.
            Can be ``'inf'`` for infinity norm.
        group_separator: The separator string used by the logger to group
            the gradients norms in their own subfolder instead of the logs one.

    Return:
        norms: The dictionary of p-norms of each parameter's gradient and
            a special entry for the total p-norm of the gradients viewed
            as a single vector.
