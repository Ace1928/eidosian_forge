def ellipord(wp, ws, gpass, gstop, analog=False, fs=None):
    """Elliptic (Cauer) filter order selection.

    Return the order of the lowest order digital or analog elliptic filter
    that loses no more than `gpass` dB in the passband and has at least
    `gstop` dB attenuation in the stopband.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wp, ws : float
        Passband and stopband edge frequencies.

        For digital filters, these are in the same units as `fs`. By default,
        `fs` is 2 half-cycles/sample, so these are normalized from 0 to 1,
        where 1 is the Nyquist frequency. (`wp` and `ws` are thus in
        half-cycles / sample.) For example:

            - Lowpass:   wp = 0.2,          ws = 0.3
            - Highpass:  wp = 0.3,          ws = 0.2
            - Bandpass:  wp = [0.2, 0.5],   ws = [0.1, 0.6]
            - Bandstop:  wp = [0.1, 0.6],   ws = [0.2, 0.5]

        For analog filters, `wp` and `ws` are angular frequencies
        (e.g., rad/s).
    gpass : float
        The maximum loss in the passband (dB).
    gstop : float
        The minimum attenuation in the stopband (dB).
    analog : bool, optional
        When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is
        returned.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the digital system.

    Returns
    -------
    ord : int
        The lowest order for an Elliptic (Cauer) filter that meets specs.
    wn : ndarray or float
        The Chebyshev natural frequency (the "3dB frequency") for use with
        `ellip` to give filter results. If `fs` is specified,
        this is in the same units, and `fs` must also be passed to `ellip`.
