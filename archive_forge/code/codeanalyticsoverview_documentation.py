        Initializes the CodeAnalytics class.
        Functions as a container for various methods to analyze and generate statistics on parsed code data.
        Initialisation ensures that the class is ready to process and analyze code data.
        The data is generated from the parsed code snippets using the CodeParser class.
        The data is then processed and analyzed using various methods to generate statistics and insights.
        The processed data and statistics and analysis are utilised over time to construct a library of code data.
        This library of code data is highly performant and valuable for various applications.
        There is no redundancy or functional overlap between anything in the universal code library.
        The universal code library aims to cover all possible code snippets, examples, and templates.
        This library can then be used to generate insights, analytics, and recommendations for code improvement.
        And can be used to train machine learning models, generate documentation, and provide code examples.
        The result being that all programs and applications have standardised high performant universal code, for any and all functions.
        This is the basis for any code analytics or code intelligence system and this aims to be the best system for any application.
