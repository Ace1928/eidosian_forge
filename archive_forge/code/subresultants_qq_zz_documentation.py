    p, q are polynomials in Z[x] (intended) or Q[x]. It is assumed
    that degree(p, x) >= degree(q, x).

    Computes the subresultant prs of p, q by triangularizing,
    in Z[x] or in Q[x], all the smaller matrices encountered in the
    process of triangularizing sylvester2, Sylvester's matrix of 1853;
    see references 1 and 2 for Van Vleck's method.

    If the sylvester2 matrix has big dimensions use this version,
    where sylvester2 is used implicitly. If you want to see the final,
    triangularized matrix sylvester2, then use the first version,
    subresultants_vv(p, q, x, 1).

    sylvester1, Sylvester's matrix of 1840, is also used to compute
    one subresultant per remainder; namely, that of the leading
    coefficient, in order to obtain the correct sign and to
    ``force'' the remainder coefficients to become subresultants.

    If the subresultant prs is complete, then it coincides with the
    Euclidean sequence of the polynomials p, q.
