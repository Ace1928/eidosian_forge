Decrypt data with the key set at initialization.

        The data to decrypt can be broken up in two or
        more pieces and `decrypt` can be called multiple times.

        That is, the statement:

            >>> c.decrypt(a) + c.decrypt(b)

        is equivalent to:

             >>> c.decrypt(a+b)

        This function does not remove any padding from the plaintext.

        :Parameters:
          ciphertext : bytes/bytearray/memoryview
            The piece of data to decrypt.
            The length must be multiple of the cipher block length.
        :Keywords:
          output : bytearray/memoryview
            The location where the plaintext must be written to.
            If ``None``, the plaintext is returned.
        :Return:
          If ``output`` is ``None``, the plaintext is returned as ``bytes``.
          Otherwise, ``None``.
