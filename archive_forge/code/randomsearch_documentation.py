Fill the hyperparameter space with values.

        Args:
            trial_id: A string, the ID for this Trial.

        Returns:
            A dictionary with keys "values" and "status", where "values" is
            a mapping of parameter names to suggested values, and "status"
            should be one of "RUNNING" (the trial can start normally), "IDLE"
            (the oracle is waiting on something and cannot create a trial), or
            "STOPPED" (the oracle has finished searching and no new trial should
            be created).
