        Perform the first pass of annotation, which makes decisions
        based purely based on the word type of each word:

          - '?', '!', and '.' are marked as sentence breaks.
          - sequences of two or more periods are marked as ellipsis.
          - any word ending in '.' that's a known abbreviation is
            marked as an abbreviation.
          - any other word ending in '.' is marked as a sentence break.
