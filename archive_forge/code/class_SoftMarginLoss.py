class SoftMarginLoss(_Loss):
    """Creates a criterion that optimizes a two-class classification
    logistic loss between input tensor :math:`x` and target tensor :math:`y`
    (containing 1 or -1).

    .. math::
        \\text{loss}(x, y) = \\sum_i \\frac{\\log(1 + \\exp(-y[i]*x[i]))}{\\text{x.nelement}()}

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(*)`, where :math:`*` means any number of dimensions.
        - Target: :math:`(*)`, same shape as the input.
        - Output: scalar. If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then :math:`(*)`, same
          shape as input.
