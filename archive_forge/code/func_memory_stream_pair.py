    """Create a connected, pure-Python, bidirectional stream with infinite
    buffering and flexible configuration options.

    This is a convenience function that creates two one-way streams using
    :func:`memory_stream_one_way_pair`, and then uses
    :class:`~trio.StapledStream` to combine them into a single bidirectional
    stream.

    This is like a no-operating-system-involved, Trio-streamsified version of
    :func:`socket.socketpair`.

    Returns:
      A pair of :class:`~trio.StapledStream` objects that are connected so
      that data automatically flows from one to the other in both directions.

    After creating a stream pair, you can send data back and forth, which is
    enough for simple tests::

       left, right = memory_stream_pair()
       await left.send_all(b"123")
       assert await right.receive_some() == b"123"
       await right.send_all(b"456")
       assert await left.receive_some() == b"456"

    But if you read the docs for :class:`~trio.StapledStream` and
    :func:`memory_stream_one_way_pair`, you'll see that all the pieces
    involved in wiring this up are public APIs, so you can adjust to suit the
    requirements of your tests. For example, here's how to tweak a stream so
    that data flowing from left to right trickles in one byte at a time (but
    data flowing from right to left proceeds at full speed)::

        left, right = memory_stream_pair()
        async def trickle():
            # left is a StapledStream, and left.send_stream is a MemorySendStream
            # right is a StapledStream, and right.recv_stream is a MemoryReceiveStream
            while memory_stream_pump(left.send_stream, right.recv_stream, max_bytes=1):
                # Pause between each byte
                await trio.sleep(1)
        # Normally this send_all_hook calls memory_stream_pump directly without
        # passing in a max_bytes. We replace it with our custom version:
        left.send_stream.send_all_hook = trickle

    And here's a simple test using our modified stream objects::

        async def sender():
            await left.send_all(b"12345")
            await left.send_eof()

        async def receiver():
            async for data in right:
                print(data)

        async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
            nursery.start_soon(sender)
            nursery.start_soon(receiver)

    By default, this will print ``b"12345"`` and then immediately exit; with
    our trickle stream it instead sleeps 1 second, then prints ``b"1"``, then
    sleeps 1 second, then prints ``b"2"``, etc.

    Pro-tip: you can insert sleep calls (like in our example above) to
    manipulate the flow of data across tasks... and then use
    :class:`MockClock` and its :attr:`~MockClock.autojump_threshold`
    functionality to keep your test suite running quickly.

    If you want to stress test a protocol implementation, one nice trick is to
    use the :mod:`random` module (preferably with a fixed seed) to move random
    numbers of bytes at a time, and insert random sleeps in between them. You
    can also set up a custom :attr:`~MemoryReceiveStream.receive_some_hook` if
    you want to manipulate things on the receiving side, and not just the
    sending side.
