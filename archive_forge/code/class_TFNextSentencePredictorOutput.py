    Base class for outputs of models predicting if two sentences are consecutive or not.

    Args:
        loss (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(n,)`, *optional*, where n is the number of non-masked labels, returned when `next_sentence_label` is provided):
            Next sentence prediction loss.
        logits (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, 2)`):
            Prediction scores of the next sequence prediction (classification) head (scores of True/False continuation
            before SoftMax).
        hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
