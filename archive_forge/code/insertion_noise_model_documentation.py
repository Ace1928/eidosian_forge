Simple base noise model for inserting operations.

    Operations generated by this model for a given moment are all added into a
    single "noise moment", which is added before or after the original moment
    based on `prepend`.

    Args:
        ops_added: a map of gate types (and optionally, qubits they act on) to
            operations that should be added. If two gate types provided apply
            to a target gate, the most specific type will match; if neither
            type is more specific (e.g. A is a subtype of B, but B defines
            qubits and A does not) then the first one appearing in this dict
            will match.
        prepend: If True, put noise before affected gates. Default: False.
        require_physical_tag: whether to only apply noise to operations tagged
            with PHYSICAL_GATE_TAG.
