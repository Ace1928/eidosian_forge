    Here we minimize x^2+y^2 subject to x^2-y^2>1.
    The actual minimum is at (0, 0) which fails the constraint.
    Therefore we will find a minimum on the boundary at (+/-1, 0).

    When minimizing on the boundary, optimize uses a set of
    constraints that removes the constraint that sets that
    boundary.  In our case, there's only one constraint, so
    the result is an empty constraint.

    This tests that the empty constraint works.
