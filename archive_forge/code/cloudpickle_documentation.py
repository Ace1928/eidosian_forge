Build dynamic enum with an empty __dict__ to be filled once memoized

    The creation of the enum class is inspired by the code of
    EnumMeta._create_.

    If class_tracker_id is not None, try to lookup an existing enum definition
    matching that id. If none is found, track a newly reconstructed enum
    definition under that id so that other instances stemming from the same
    class id will also reuse this enum definition.

    The "extra" variable is meant to be a dict (or None) that can be used for
    forward compatibility shall the need arise.
