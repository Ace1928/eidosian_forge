    """Represents a HA VPN gateway. HA VPN is a high-availability (HA) Cloud
  VPN solution that lets you securely connect your on-premises network to your
  Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud network through an IPsec VPN connection
  in a single region. For more information about Cloud HA VPN solutions, see
  Cloud VPN topologies .

  Enums:
    GatewayIpVersionValueValuesEnum: The IP family of the gateway IPs for the
      HA-VPN gateway interfaces. If not specified, IPV4 will be used.
    StackTypeValueValuesEnum: The stack type for this VPN gateway to identify
      the IP protocols that are enabled. Possible values are: IPV4_ONLY,
      IPV4_IPV6. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    gatewayIpVersion: The IP family of the gateway IPs for the HA-VPN gateway
      interfaces. If not specified, IPV4 will be used.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#vpnGateway for VPN
      gateways.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      VpnGateway, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a VpnGateway.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: URL of the network to which this VPN gateway is attached.
      Provided by the client when the VPN gateway is created.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the VPN gateway resides.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    stackType: The stack type for this VPN gateway to identify the IP
      protocols that are enabled. Possible values are: IPV4_ONLY, IPV4_IPV6.
      If not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be used.
    vpnInterfaces: The list of VPN interfaces associated with this VPN
      gateway.
