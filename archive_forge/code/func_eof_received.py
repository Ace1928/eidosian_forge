        Close the transport after receiving EOF.

        The WebSocket protocol has its own closing handshake: endpoints close
        the TCP or TLS connection after sending and receiving a close frame.

        As a consequence, they never need to write after receiving EOF, so
        there's no reason to keep the transport open by returning :obj:`True`.

        Besides, that doesn't work on TLS connections.
