class ConditionalDetrModelOutput(Seq2SeqModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for outputs of the Conditional DETR encoder-decoder model. This class adds one attribute to
    Seq2SeqModelOutput, namely an optional stack of intermediate decoder activations, i.e. the output of each decoder
    layer, each of them gone through a layernorm. This is useful when training the model with auxiliary decoding
    losses.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.
        decoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each
            layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        decoder_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the self-attention heads.
        cross_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the decoder's cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax,
            used to compute the weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
        encoder_last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder of the model.
        encoder_hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. Hidden-states of the encoder at the output of each
            layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        encoder_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights of the encoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the
            weighted average in the self-attention heads.
        intermediate_hidden_states (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(config.decoder_layers, batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*, returned when `config.auxiliary_loss=True`):
            Intermediate decoder activations, i.e. the output of each decoder layer, each of them gone through a
            layernorm.
