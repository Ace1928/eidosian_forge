    p, q are polynomials in Z[x] or Q[x]. It is assumed
    that degree(p, x) >= degree(q, x).

    Computes the Euclidean sequence of p and q in Z[x] or Q[x].

    If the Euclidean sequence is complete the coefficients of the polynomials
    in the sequence are subresultants. That is, they are  determinants of
    appropriately selected submatrices of sylvester1, Sylvester's matrix of 1840.
    In this case the Euclidean sequence coincides with the subresultant prs
    of the polynomials p, q.

    If the Euclidean sequence is incomplete the signs of the coefficients of the
    polynomials in the sequence may differ from the signs of the coefficients of
    the corresponding polynomials in the subresultant prs; however, the absolute
    values are the same.

    To compute the Euclidean sequence, no determinant evaluation takes place.
    We first compute the (generalized) Sturm sequence  of p and q using
    sturm_pg(p, q, x, 1), in which case the coefficients are (in absolute value)
    equal to subresultants. Then we change the signs of the remainders in the
    Sturm sequence according to the pattern "-, -, +, +, -, -, +, +,..." ;
    see Lemma 1 in the 1st reference or Theorem 3 in the 2nd reference as well as
    the function sturm_pg(p, q, x).
