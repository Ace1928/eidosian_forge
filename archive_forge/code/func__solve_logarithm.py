def _solve_logarithm(lhs, rhs, symbol, domain):
    """
    Helper to solve logarithmic equations which are reducible
    to a single instance of `\\log`.

    Logarithmic equations are (currently) the equations that contains
    `\\log` terms which can be reduced to a single `\\log` term or
    a constant using various logarithmic identities.

    For example:

    .. math:: \\log(x) + \\log(x - 4)

    can be reduced to:

    .. math:: \\log(x(x - 4))

    Parameters
    ==========

    lhs, rhs : Expr
        The logarithmic equation to be solved, `lhs = rhs`

    symbol : Symbol
        The variable in which the equation is solved

    domain : Set
        A set over which the equation is solved.

    Returns
    =======

    A set of solutions satisfying the given equation.
    A ``ConditionSet`` if the equation is unsolvable.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, log, S
    >>> from sympy.solvers.solveset import _solve_logarithm as solve_log
    >>> x = symbols('x')
    >>> f = log(x - 3) + log(x + 3)
    >>> solve_log(f, 0, x, S.Reals)
    {-sqrt(10), sqrt(10)}

    * Proof of correctness

    A logarithm is another way to write exponent and is defined by

    .. math:: {\\log_b x} = y \\enspace if \\enspace b^y = x

    When one side of the equation contains a single logarithm, the
    equation can be solved by rewriting the equation as an equivalent
    exponential equation as defined above. But if one side contains
    more than one logarithm, we need to use the properties of logarithm
    to condense it into a single logarithm.

    Take for example

    .. math:: \\log(2x) - 15 = 0

    contains single logarithm, therefore we can directly rewrite it to
    exponential form as

    .. math:: x = \\frac{e^{15}}{2}

    But if the equation has more than one logarithm as

    .. math:: \\log(x - 3) + \\log(x + 3) = 0

    we use logarithmic identities to convert it into a reduced form

    Using,

    .. math:: \\log(a) + \\log(b) = \\log(ab)

    the equation becomes,

    .. math:: \\log((x - 3)(x + 3))

    This equation contains one logarithm and can be solved by rewriting
    to exponents.
