        Set the drawstyle of the plot.

        The drawstyle determines how the points are connected.

        Parameters
        ----------
        drawstyle : {'default', 'steps', 'steps-pre', 'steps-mid', 'steps-post'}, default: 'default'
            For 'default', the points are connected with straight lines.

            The steps variants connect the points with step-like lines,
            i.e. horizontal lines with vertical steps. They differ in the
            location of the step:

            - 'steps-pre': The step is at the beginning of the line segment,
              i.e. the line will be at the y-value of point to the right.
            - 'steps-mid': The step is halfway between the points.
            - 'steps-post: The step is at the end of the line segment,
              i.e. the line will be at the y-value of the point to the left.
            - 'steps' is equal to 'steps-pre' and is maintained for
              backward-compatibility.

            For examples see :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/step_demo`.
