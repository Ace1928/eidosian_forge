        Override this method in subclasses to support platform-specific
        file transmission.  It is only called if the application's
        return iterable ('self.result') is an instance of
        'self.wsgi_file_wrapper'.

        This method should return a true value if it was able to actually
        transmit the wrapped file-like object using a platform-specific
        approach.  It should return a false value if normal iteration
        should be used instead.  An exception can be raised to indicate
        that transmission was attempted, but failed.

        NOTE: this method should call 'self.send_headers()' if
        'self.headers_sent' is false and it is going to attempt direct
        transmission of the file.
