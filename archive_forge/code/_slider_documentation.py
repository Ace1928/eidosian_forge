        Construct a new Slider object

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
            an instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.layout.Slider`
        active
            Determines which button (by index starting from 0) is
            considered active.
        activebgcolor
            Sets the background color of the slider grip while
            dragging.
        bgcolor
            Sets the background color of the slider.
        bordercolor
            Sets the color of the border enclosing the slider.
        borderwidth
            Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the
            slider.
        currentvalue
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.slider.Currentvalue
            ` instance or dict with compatible properties
        font
            Sets the font of the slider step labels.
        len
            Sets the length of the slider This measure excludes the
            padding of both ends. That is, the slider's length is
            this length minus the padding on both ends.
        lenmode
            Determines whether this slider length is set in units
            of plot "fraction" or in *pixels. Use `len` to set the
            value.
        minorticklen
            Sets the length in pixels of minor step tick marks
        name
            When used in a template, named items are created in the
            output figure in addition to any items the figure
            already has in this array. You can modify these items
            in the output figure by making your own item with
            `templateitemname` matching this `name` alongside your
            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
            false` to hide it). Has no effect outside of a
            template.
        pad
            Set the padding of the slider component along each
            side.
        steps
            A tuple of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.slider.Step`
            instances or dicts with compatible properties
        stepdefaults
            When used in a template (as
            layout.template.layout.slider.stepdefaults), sets the
            default property values to use for elements of
            layout.slider.steps
        templateitemname
            Used to refer to a named item in this array in the
            template. Named items from the template will be created
            even without a matching item in the input figure, but
            you can modify one by making an item with
            `templateitemname` matching its `name`, alongside your
            modifications (including `visible: false` or `enabled:
            false` to hide it). If there is no template or no
            matching item, this item will be hidden unless you
            explicitly show it with `visible: true`.
        tickcolor
            Sets the color of the border enclosing the slider.
        ticklen
            Sets the length in pixels of step tick marks
        tickwidth
            Sets the tick width (in px).
        transition
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.slider.Transition`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not the slider is visible.
        x
            Sets the x position (in normalized coordinates) of the
            slider.
        xanchor
            Sets the slider's horizontal position anchor. This
            anchor binds the `x` position to the "left", "center"
            or "right" of the range selector.
        y
            Sets the y position (in normalized coordinates) of the
            slider.
        yanchor
            Sets the slider's vertical position anchor This anchor
            binds the `y` position to the "top", "middle" or
            "bottom" of the range selector.
