        This subclass handles the case where one or both coordinates should be
        taken modulo 360, or be restricted to not exceed a specific range.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nx, ny : int
            The number of samples in each direction.

        lon_cycle, lat_cycle : 360 or None
            If not None, values in the corresponding direction are taken modulo
            *lon_cycle* or *lat_cycle*; in theory this can be any number but
            the implementation actually assumes that it is 360 (if not None);
            other values give nonsensical results.

            This is done by "unwrapping" the transformed grid coordinates so
            that jumps are less than a half-cycle; then normalizing the span to
            no more than a full cycle.

            For example, if values are in the union of the [0, 2] and
            [358, 360] intervals (typically, angles measured modulo 360), the
            values in the second interval are normalized to [-2, 0] instead so
            that the values now cover [-2, 2].  If values are in a range of
            [5, 1000], this gets normalized to [5, 365].

        lon_minmax, lat_minmax : (float, float) or None
            If not None, the computed bounding box is clipped to the given
            range in the corresponding direction.
