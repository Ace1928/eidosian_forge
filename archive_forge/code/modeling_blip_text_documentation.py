        encoder_hidden_states (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*): Sequence of
            hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if the model is
            configured as a decoder.
        encoder_attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
            the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.
        labels (`torch.LongTensor`, *optional*):
            Labels for computing the left-to-right language modeling loss (next word prediction). Indices should be in
            `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are
            ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels n `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, *optional*):
            Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.
            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).
