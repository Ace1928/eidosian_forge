class _NumberKind(Kind):
    """
    Kind for all numeric object.

    This kind represents every number, including complex numbers,
    infinity and ``S.NaN``. Other objects such as quaternions do not
    have this kind.

    Most ``Expr`` are initially designed to represent the number, so
    this will be the most common kind in SymPy core. For example
    ``Symbol()``, which represents a scalar, has this kind as long as it
    is commutative.

    Numbers form a field. Any operation between number-kind objects will
    result this kind as well.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S, oo, Symbol
    >>> S.One.kind
    NumberKind
    >>> (-oo).kind
    NumberKind
    >>> S.NaN.kind
    NumberKind

    Commutative symbol are treated as number.

    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> x.kind
    NumberKind
    >>> Symbol('y', commutative=False).kind
    UndefinedKind

    Operation between numbers results number.

    >>> (x+1).kind
    NumberKind
