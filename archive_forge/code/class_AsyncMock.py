    Enhance :class:`Mock` with features allowing to mock
    an async function.

    The :class:`AsyncMock` object will behave so the object is
    recognized as an async function, and the result of a call is an awaitable:

    >>> mock = AsyncMock()
    >>> iscoroutinefunction(mock)
    True
    >>> inspect.isawaitable(mock())
    True


    The result of ``mock()`` is an async function which will have the outcome
    of ``side_effect`` or ``return_value``:

    - if ``side_effect`` is a function, the async function will return the
      result of that function,
    - if ``side_effect`` is an exception, the async function will raise the
      exception,
    - if ``side_effect`` is an iterable, the async function will return the
      next value of the iterable, however, if the sequence of result is
      exhausted, ``StopIteration`` is raised immediately,
    - if ``side_effect`` is not defined, the async function will return the
      value defined by ``return_value``, hence, by default, the async function
      returns a new :class:`AsyncMock` object.

    If the outcome of ``side_effect`` or ``return_value`` is an async function,
    the mock async function obtained when the mock object is called will be this
    async function itself (and not an async function returning an async
    function).

    The test author can also specify a wrapped object with ``wraps``. In this
    case, the :class:`Mock` object behavior is the same as with an
    :class:`.Mock` object: the wrapped object may have methods
    defined as async function functions.

    Based on Martin Richard's asynctest project.
