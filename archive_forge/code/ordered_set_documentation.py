        Update this OrderedSet to remove items from another set, then
        add items from the other set that were not present in this set.

        Example:
            >>> this = OrderedSet([1, 4, 3, 5, 7])
            >>> other = OrderedSet([9, 7, 1, 3, 2])
            >>> this.symmetric_difference_update(other)
            >>> print(this)
            OrderedSet([4, 5, 9, 2])
