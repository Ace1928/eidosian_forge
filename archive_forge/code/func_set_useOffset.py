def set_useOffset(self, val):
    """
        Set whether to use offset notation.

        When formatting a set numbers whose value is large compared to their
        range, the formatter can separate an additive constant. This can
        shorten the formatted numbers so that they are less likely to overlap
        when drawn on an axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        val : bool or float
            - If False, do not use offset notation.
            - If True (=automatic mode), use offset notation if it can make
              the residual numbers significantly shorter. The exact behavior
              is controlled by :rc:`axes.formatter.offset_threshold`.
            - If a number, force an offset of the given value.

        Examples
        --------
        With active offset notation, the values

        ``100_000, 100_002, 100_004, 100_006, 100_008``

        will be formatted as ``0, 2, 4, 6, 8`` plus an offset ``+1e5``, which
        is written to the edge of the axis.
