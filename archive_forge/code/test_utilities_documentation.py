import sys

        Tests that ``code`` raises the exception ``expectedException``.

        ``code`` may be a callable, such as a lambda expression or function
        name.

        If ``code`` is not given or None, ``raises`` will return a context
        manager for use in ``with`` statements; the code to execute then
        comes from the scope of the ``with``.

        ``raises()`` does nothing if the callable raises the expected
        exception, otherwise it raises an AssertionError.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from symengine.pytest import raises

        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: 1/0)
        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: 1/2)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: DID NOT RAISE

        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        ...     n = 1/0
        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        ...     n = 1/2
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: DID NOT RAISE

        Note that you cannot test multiple statements via
        ``with raises``:

        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        ...     n = 1/0    # will execute and raise, aborting the ``with``
        ...     n = 9999/0 # never executed

        This is just what ``with`` is supposed to do: abort the
        contained statement sequence at the first exception and let
        the context manager deal with the exception.

        To test multiple statements, you'll need a separate ``with``
        for each:

        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        ...     n = 1/0    # will execute and raise
        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):
        ...     n = 9999/0 # will also execute and raise
