        masked_lm_labels (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should be in `[-100, 0, ...,
            config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the
            loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
        obj_labels (`Dict[Str: Tuple[tf.Tensor, tf.Tensor]]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            each key is named after each one of the visual losses and each element of the tuple is of the shape
            `(batch_size, num_features)` and `(batch_size, num_features, visual_feature_dim)` for each the label id and
            the label score respectively
        matched_label (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*):
            Labels for computing the whether or not the text input matches the image (classification) loss. Input
            should be a sequence pair (see `input_ids` docstring) Indices should be in `[0, 1]`:

            - 0 indicates that the sentence does not match the image,
            - 1 indicates that the sentence does match the image.
        ans (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size)`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            a one hot representation hof the correct answer *optional*

        Returns:
