class IdentityMorphism(Morphism):
    """
    Represents an identity morphism.

    Explanation
    ===========

    An identity morphism is a morphism with equal domain and codomain,
    which acts as an identity with respect to composition.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.categories import Object, NamedMorphism, IdentityMorphism
    >>> A = Object("A")
    >>> B = Object("B")
    >>> f = NamedMorphism(A, B, "f")
    >>> id_A = IdentityMorphism(A)
    >>> id_B = IdentityMorphism(B)
    >>> f * id_A == f
    True
    >>> id_B * f == f
    True
