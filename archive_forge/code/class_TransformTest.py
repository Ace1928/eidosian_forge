class TransformTest(CythonTest):
    """
    Utility base class for transform unit tests. It is based around constructing
    test trees (either explicitly or by parsing a Cython code string); running
    the transform, serialize it using a customized Cython serializer (with
    special markup for nodes that cannot be represented in Cython),
    and do a string-comparison line-by-line of the result.

    To create a test case:
     - Call run_pipeline. The pipeline should at least contain the transform you
       are testing; pyx should be either a string (passed to the parser to
       create a post-parse tree) or a node representing input to pipeline.
       The result will be a transformed result.

     - Check that the tree is correct. If wanted, assertCode can be used, which
       takes a code string as expected, and a ModuleNode in result_tree
       (it serializes the ModuleNode to a string and compares line-by-line).

    All code strings are first stripped for whitespace lines and then common
    indentation.

    Plans: One could have a pxd dictionary parameter to run_pipeline.
