        The final markup may or may not actually present this tag as

        For instance: an HTMLBuilder does not consider a <p> tag to be
        an empty-element tag (it's not in
        HTMLBuilder.empty_element_tags). This means an empty <p> tag
        will be presented as "<p></p>", not "<p/>" or "<p>".

        The default implementation has no opinion about which tags are
        empty-element tags, so a tag will be presented as an
        empty-element tag if and only if it has no children.
        "<foo></foo>" will become "<foo/>", and "<foo>bar</foo>" will
        be left alone.
