    Minimize a linear objective function subject to linear equality and
    non-negativity constraints using the two phase simplex method.
    Linear programming is intended to solve problems of the following form:

    Minimize::

        c @ x

    Subject to::

        A @ x == b
            x >= 0

    User-facing documentation is in _linprog_doc.py.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array
        Coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
    c0 : float
        Constant term in objective function due to fixed (and eliminated)
        variables. (Purely for display.)
    A : 2-D array
        2-D array such that ``A @ x``, gives the values of the equality
        constraints at ``x``.
    b : 1-D array
        1-D array of values representing the right hand side of each equality
        constraint (row) in ``A``.
    callback : callable, optional
        If a callback function is provided, it will be called within each
        iteration of the algorithm. The callback function must accept a single
        `scipy.optimize.OptimizeResult` consisting of the following fields:

            x : 1-D array
                Current solution vector
            fun : float
                Current value of the objective function
            success : bool
                True when an algorithm has completed successfully.
            slack : 1-D array
                The values of the slack variables. Each slack variable
                corresponds to an inequality constraint. If the slack is zero,
                the corresponding constraint is active.
            con : 1-D array
                The (nominally zero) residuals of the equality constraints,
                that is, ``b - A_eq @ x``
            phase : int
                The phase of the algorithm being executed.
            status : int
                An integer representing the status of the optimization::

                     0 : Algorithm proceeding nominally
                     1 : Iteration limit reached
                     2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
                     3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
                     4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered
            nit : int
                The number of iterations performed.
            message : str
                A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
    postsolve_args : tuple
        Data needed by _postsolve to convert the solution to the standard-form
        problem into the solution to the original problem.

    Options
    -------
    maxiter : int
       The maximum number of iterations to perform.
    disp : bool
        If True, print exit status message to sys.stdout
    tol : float
        The tolerance which determines when a solution is "close enough" to
        zero in Phase 1 to be considered a basic feasible solution or close
        enough to positive to serve as an optimal solution.
    bland : bool
        If True, use Bland's anti-cycling rule [3]_ to choose pivots to
        prevent cycling. If False, choose pivots which should lead to a
        converged solution more quickly. The latter method is subject to
        cycling (non-convergence) in rare instances.
    unknown_options : dict
        Optional arguments not used by this particular solver. If
        `unknown_options` is non-empty a warning is issued listing all
        unused options.

    Returns
    -------
    x : 1-D array
        Solution vector.
    status : int
        An integer representing the exit status of the optimization::

         0 : Optimization terminated successfully
         1 : Iteration limit reached
         2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
         3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
         4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered

    message : str
        A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
    iteration : int
        The number of iterations taken to solve the problem.

    Notes
    -----
    The expected problem formulation differs between the top level ``linprog``
    module and the method specific solvers. The method specific solvers expect a
    problem in standard form:

    Minimize::

        c @ x

    Subject to::

        A @ x == b
            x >= 0

    Whereas the top level ``linprog`` module expects a problem of form:

    Minimize::

        c @ x

    Subject to::

        A_ub @ x <= b_ub
        A_eq @ x == b_eq
         lb <= x <= ub

    where ``lb = 0`` and ``ub = None`` unless set in ``bounds``.

    The original problem contains equality, upper-bound and variable constraints
    whereas the method specific solver requires equality constraints and
    variable non-negativity.

    ``linprog`` module converts the original problem to standard form by
    converting the simple bounds to upper bound constraints, introducing
    non-negative slack variables for inequality constraints, and expressing
    unbounded variables as the difference between two non-negative variables.
