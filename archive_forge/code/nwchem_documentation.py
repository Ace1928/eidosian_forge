        NWChem keywords are specified using (potentially nested)
        dictionaries. Consider the following input file block:

        >>> dft
        >>>   odft
        >>>   mult 2
        >>>   convergence energy 1e-9 density 1e-7 gradient 5e-6
        >>> end

        This can be generated by the NWChem calculator by using the
        following settings:

        >>> calc = NWChem(dft={'odft': None,
        >>>                    'mult': 2,
        >>>                    'convergence': {'energy': 1e-9,
        >>>                                    'density': 1e-7,
        >>>                                    'gradient': 5e-6,
        >>>                                    },
        >>>                    },
        >>>               )

        In addition, the calculator supports several special keywords:

        theory: str
            Which NWChem module should be used to calculate the
            energies and forces. Supported values are ``'dft'``,
            ``'scf'``, ``'mp2'``, ``'ccsd'``, ``'tce'``, ``'tddft'``,
            ``'pspw'``, ``'band'``, and ``'paw'``. If not provided, the
            calculator will attempt to guess which theory to use based
            on the keywords provided by the user.
        xc: str
            The exchange-correlation functional to use. Only relevant
            for DFT calculations.
        task: str
            What type of calculation is to be performed, e.g.
            ``'energy'``, ``'gradient'``, ``'optimize'``, etc. When
            using ``'SocketIOCalculator'``, ``task`` should be set
            to ``'optimize'``. In most other circumstances, ``task``
            should not be set manually.
        basis: str or dict
            Which basis set to use for gaussian-type orbital
            calculations. Set to a string to use the same basis for all
            elements. To use a different basis for different elements,
            provide a dict of the form:

            >>> calc = NWChem(...,
            >>>               basis={'O': '3-21G',
            >>>                      'Si': '6-31g'})

        basispar: str
            Additional keywords to put in the NWChem ``basis`` block,
            e.g. ``'rel'`` for relativistic bases.
        symmetry: int or str
            The point group (for gaussian-type orbital calculations) or
            space group (for plane-wave calculations) of the system.
            Supports both group names (e.g. ``'c2v'``, ``'Fm3m'``) and
            numbers (e.g. ``225``).
        autosym: bool
            Whether NWChem should automatically determine the symmetry
            of the structure (defaults to ``False``).
        center: bool
            Whether NWChem should automatically center the structure
            (defaults to ``False``). Enable at your own risk.
        autoz: bool
            Whether NWChem should automatically construct a Z-matrix
            for your molecular system (defaults to ``False``).
        geompar: str
            Additional keywords to put in the NWChem `geometry` block,
            e.g. ``'nucleus finite'`` for gaussian-shaped nuclear
            charges. Do not set ``'autosym'``, ``'center'``, or
            ``'autoz'`` in this way; instead, use the appropriate
            keyword described above for these settings.
        set: dict
            Used to manually create or modify entries in the NWChem
            rtdb. For example, the following settings enable
            pseudopotential filtering for plane-wave calculations:

            >>> set nwpw:kbpp_ray .true.
            >>> set nwpw:kbpp_filter .true.

            These settings are generated by the NWChem calculator by
            passing the arguments:

            >>> calc = NWChem(...,
            >>>               set={'nwpw:kbpp_ray': True,
            >>>                    'nwpw:kbpp_filter': True})

        kpts: (int, int, int), or dict
            Indicates which k-point mesh to use. Supported syntax is
            similar to that of GPAW. Implies ``theory='band'``.
        bandpath: BandPath object
            The band path to use for a band structure calculation.
            Implies ``theory='band'``.
