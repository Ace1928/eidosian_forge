    """A runtime using a Compute Engine instance.

  Messages:
    VmTagsValue: Optional. Resource manager tags to be bound to this instance.
      Tag keys and values have the same definition as
      https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/tags/tags-overview Keys
      must be in the format `tagKeys/{tag_key_id}`, and values are in the
      format `tagValues/456`.

  Fields:
    accelerators: Optional. A list of the type and count of accelerator cards
      attached to the instance.
    boostConfigs: Optional. A list of the boost configurations that
      workstations created using this workstation configuration are allowed to
      use.
    bootDiskSizeGb: Optional. The size of the boot disk for the VM in
      gigabytes (GB). The minimum boot disk size is `30` GB. Defaults to `50`
      GB.
    confidentialInstanceConfig: Optional. A set of Compute Engine Confidential
      VM instance options.
    disablePublicIpAddresses: Optional. When set to true, disables public IP
      addresses for VMs. If you disable public IP addresses, you must set up
      Private Google Access or Cloud NAT on your network. If you use Private
      Google Access and you use `private.googleapis.com` or
      `restricted.googleapis.com` for Container Registry and Artifact
      Registry, make sure that you set up DNS records for domains `*.gcr.io`
      and `*.pkg.dev`. Defaults to false (VMs have public IP addresses).
    disableSsh: Optional. Whether to disable SSH access to the VM.
    enableNestedVirtualization: Optional. Whether to enable nested
      virtualization on Cloud Workstations VMs created using this workstation
      configuration. Nested virtualization lets you run virtual machine (VM)
      instances inside your workstation. Before enabling nested
      virtualization, consider the following important considerations. Cloud
      Workstations instances are subject to the [same restrictions as Compute
      Engine
      instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-
      virtualization/overview#restrictions): * **Organization policy**:
      projects, folders, or organizations may be restricted from creating
      nested VMs if the **Disable VM nested virtualization** constraint is
      enforced in the organization policy. For more information, see the
      Compute Engine section, [Checking whether nested virtualization is
      allowed](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/nested-
      virtualization/managing-
      constraint#checking_whether_nested_virtualization_is_allowed). *
      **Performance**: nested VMs might experience a 10% or greater decrease
      in performance for workloads that are CPU-bound and possibly greater
      than a 10% decrease for workloads that are input/output bound. *
      **Machine Type**: nested virtualization can only be enabled on
      workstation configurations that specify a machine_type in the N1 or N2
      machine series. * **GPUs**: nested virtualization may not be enabled on
      workstation configurations with accelerators. * **Operating System**:
      Because [Container-Optimized
      OS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#container-
      optimized_os_cos) does not support nested virtualization, when nested
      virtualization is enabled, the underlying Compute Engine VM instances
      boot from an [Ubuntu
      LTS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#ubuntu_lts)
      image.
    machineType: Optional. The type of machine to use for VM instances-for
      example, `"e2-standard-4"`. For more information about machine types
      that Cloud Workstations supports, see the list of [available machine
      types](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/available-machine-
      types).
    poolSize: Optional. The number of VMs that the system should keep idle so
      that new workstations can be started quickly for new users. Defaults to
      `0` in the API.
    pooledInstances: Output only. Number of instances currently available in
      the pool for faster workstation startup.
    serviceAccount: Optional. The email address of the service account for
      Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration. When specified,
      be sure that the service account has `logginglogEntries.create`
      permission on the project so it can write logs out to Cloud Logging. If
      using a custom container image, the service account must have [Artifact
      Registry Reader](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-
      control#roles) permission to pull the specified image. If you as the
      administrator want to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, you need
      to set this value to a service account for which you have the
      `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission. Conversely, if you don't want
      anyone to be able to `ssh` into the underlying VM, use a service account
      where no one has that permission. If not set, VMs run with a service
      account provided by the Cloud Workstations service, and the image must
      be publicly accessible.
    serviceAccountScopes: Optional. Scopes to grant to the service_account.
      Various scopes are automatically added based on feature usage. When
      specified, users of workstations under this configuration must have
      `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` on the service account.
    shieldedInstanceConfig: Optional. A set of Compute Engine Shielded
      instance options.
    tags: Optional. Network tags to add to the Compute Engine VMs backing the
      workstations. This option applies [network
      tags](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags) to VMs
      created with this configuration. These network tags enable the creation
      of [firewall
      rules](https://cloud.google.com/workstations/docs/configure-firewall-
      rules).
    vmTags: Optional. Resource manager tags to be bound to this instance. Tag
      keys and values have the same definition as
      https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/tags/tags-overview Keys
      must be in the format `tagKeys/{tag_key_id}`, and values are in the
      format `tagValues/456`.
