Patch the ``state_dict`` and ``load_state_dict`` attributes of ``optimizers``.

    Patch the ``state_dict`` and ``load_state_dict`` attributes of ``optimizers`` to
    be a partial function to call ``get_state_dict`` and ``set_state_dict``.

    Note that if there are multiple optimizers, all of the optimizers will be patched.
    So users only need to call one of the state_dict() to get the full result.

    Example:
        from torch.distributed.fsdp import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP
        from torch.distributed.checkpoint.state_dict import patch_model_state_dict

        model = fsdp(model)
        patch_model_state_dict(model)

    Args:
        model (nn.Module): the nn.Module to the model.
        options (StateDictOptions): the options to control how
            model state_dict and optimizer state_dict should be loaded. See
            `StateDictOptions` for the details.
    Returns:
        None
