    """
        Develops cusp to assign to each horotriangle the positions of its three
        vertices in the Euclidean plane.

        Note: For a complete cusp, this is defined only up to translating the
        entire triangle by translations generated by meridian and longitude.

        For an incomplete cusp, this is defined only up to
        similarities generated by the meridian and longitude. The
        positions can be moved such that the fixed point of these
        similarities is at the origin by calling
        move_fixed_point_to_zero after
        add_vertex_positions_to_horotriangles.

        Note: This is not working when one_cocycle is passed during the
        construction of the cusp cross section.
