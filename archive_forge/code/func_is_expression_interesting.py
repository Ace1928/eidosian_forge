    """
    Determines if an expression is potentially interesting, at least in my opinion.
    Returns False for the following expressions whose value is generally obvious:
        - Literals (e.g. 123, 'abc', [1, 2, 3], {'a': (), 'b': ([1, 2], [3])})
        - Variables or attributes whose name is equal to the value's __name__.
            For example, a function `def foo(): ...` is not interesting when referred to
            as `foo` as it usually would, but `bar` can be interesting if `bar is foo`.
            Similarly the method `self.foo` is not interesting.
        - Builtins (e.g. `len`) referred to by their usual name.

    This is a low level API, typically you will use `interesting_expressions_grouped`.
