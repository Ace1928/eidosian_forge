This searches 'buffer' for the first occurrence of one of the regular
        expressions. 'freshlen' must indicate the number of bytes at the end of
        'buffer' which have not been searched before.

        See class spawn for the 'searchwindowsize' argument.

        If there is a match this returns the index of that string, and sets
        'start', 'end' and 'match'. Otherwise, returns -1.
