    Mark the start of a range with string message. It returns an unique handle
    for this range to pass to the corresponding call to rangeEnd().

    A key difference between this and range_push/range_pop is that the
    range_start/range_end version supports range across threads (start on one
    thread and end on another thread).

    Returns: A range handle (uint64_t) that can be passed to range_end().

    Args:
        msg (str): ASCII message to associate with the range.
