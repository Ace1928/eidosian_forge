        encoder_hidden_states  (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention if
            the model is configured as a decoder.
        encoder_attention_mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Mask to avoid performing attention on the padding token indices of the encoder input. This mask is used in
            the cross-attention if the model is configured as a decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
            - 0 for tokens that are **masked**.

        labels (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, *optional*):
            Labels for computing the left-to-right language modeling loss (next word prediction). Indices should be in
            `[-100, 0, ..., config.vocab_size]` (see `input_ids` docstring) Tokens with indices set to `-100` are
            ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`
        past_key_values (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`):
            Contains precomputed key and value hidden states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding.

            If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that
            don't have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all
            `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see
            `past_key_values`).

        Returns:

        Example:

        ```python
        >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, CamembertForCausalLM, AutoConfig
        >>> import torch

        >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("almanach/camembert-base")
        >>> config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("almanach/camembert-base")
        >>> config.is_decoder = True
        >>> model = CamembertForCausalLM.from_pretrained("almanach/camembert-base", config=config)

        >>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
        >>> outputs = model(**inputs)

        >>> prediction_logits = outputs.logits
        ```
