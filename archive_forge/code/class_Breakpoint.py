    Implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and
    (re)-enabling, and conditionals.

    Breakpoints are indexed by number through bpbynumber and by
    the (file, line) tuple using bplist.  The former points to a
    single instance of class Breakpoint.  The latter points to a
    list of such instances since there may be more than one
    breakpoint per line.

    When creating a breakpoint, its associated filename should be
    in canonical form.  If funcname is defined, a breakpoint hit will be
    counted when the first line of that function is executed.  A
    conditional breakpoint always counts a hit.
