N537 - Don't translate logs.

    Check for 'LOG.*(_(' and 'LOG.*(_Lx('

    Translators don't provide translations for log messages, and operators
    asked not to translate them.

    * This check assumes that 'LOG' is a logger.

    :param logical_line: The logical line to check.
    :param filename: The file name where the logical line exists.
    :returns: None if the logical line passes the check, otherwise a tuple
        is yielded that contains the offending index in logical line and a
        message describe the check validation failure.
