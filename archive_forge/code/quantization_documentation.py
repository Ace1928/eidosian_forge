    Quantize the input tensors, choose the precision types, and pass other necessary arguments and then dequantizes the output.

    Currently it only supports:
        . FP16 and BFP16 quantization method supported for gloo and nccl backends
        . all_gather, all_to_all collective ops
    Note: BFP16 only supports 2D tensors.
    Args:
        func (Callable): A function representing collective operations.
        qtype (QuantType): Quantization method
        quant_loss (float, optional): This can be used to improve accuracy in the dequantization.
    Returns:
        (Callable): the same collective as func but enables automatic quantization/dequantization.
