        Args:
            x (OrderedDict[Tensor]): feature maps for each level. They are assumed to have
                all the same number of channels, but they can have different sizes.
            boxes (List[Tensor[N, 4]]): boxes to be used to perform the pooling operation, in
                (x1, y1, x2, y2) format and in the image reference size, not the feature map
                reference. The coordinate must satisfy ``0 <= x1 < x2`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2``.
            image_shapes (List[Tuple[height, width]]): the sizes of each image before they
                have been fed to a CNN to obtain feature maps. This allows us to infer the
                scale factor for each one of the levels to be pooled.
        Returns:
            result (Tensor)
