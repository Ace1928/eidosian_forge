class TFBaseModelOutputWithPast(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for model's outputs that may also contain a past key/values (to speed up sequential decoding).

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.

            If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1,
            hidden_size)` is output.
        past_key_values (`List[tf.Tensor]`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
            List of `tf.Tensor` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tensor of shape `(2, batch_size, num_heads,
            sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`).

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used (see
            `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
        hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
