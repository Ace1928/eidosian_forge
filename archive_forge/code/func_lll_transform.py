        Performs the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) basis reduction algorithm
        and returns the reduced basis and transformation matrix.

        Explanation
        ===========

        Parameters, algorithm and basis are the same as for :meth:`lll` except that
        the return value is a tuple `(B, T)` with `B` the reduced basis and
        `T` a transformation matrix. The original basis `A` is transformed to
        `B` with `T*A == B`. If only `B` is needed then :meth:`lll` should be
        used as it is a little faster.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.polys.domains import ZZ, QQ
        >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DM
        >>> X = DM([[1, 0, 0, 0, -20160],
        ...         [0, 1, 0, 0, 33768],
        ...         [0, 0, 1, 0, 39578],
        ...         [0, 0, 0, 1, 47757]], ZZ)
        >>> B, T = X.lll_transform(delta=QQ(5, 6))
        >>> T * X == B
        True
