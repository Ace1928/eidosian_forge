import logging

        Methodically converts a list of code blocks into a structured pseudocode format. Each code block is processed
        to generate a corresponding pseudocode representation, which is then meticulously compiled into a single
        pseudocode document, ensuring no detail is overlooked.

        Parameters:
            code_blocks (list of str): A list containing blocks of Python code as strings, each representing distinct logical segments.

        Returns:
            str: A string representing the complete, detailed pseudocode derived from the input code blocks, ensuring high readability and accuracy.
