def _download_from_fs_path(fs: pyarrow.fs.FileSystem, fs_path: str, local_path: str, filelock: bool=True):
    """Downloads a directory or file from (fs, fs_path) to a local path.

    If fs_path points to a directory:
    - The full directory contents are downloaded directly into `local_path`,
      rather than to a subdirectory of `local_path`.

    If fs_path points to a file:
    - The file is downloaded to `local_path`, which is expected to be a file path.

    If the download fails, the `local_path` contents are
    cleaned up before raising, if the directory did not previously exist.

    NOTE: This method creates `local_path`'s parent directories if they do not
    already exist. If the download fails, this does NOT clean up all the parent
    directories that were created.

    Args:
        fs: The filesystem to download from.
        fs_path: The filesystem path (either a directory or a file) to download.
        local_path: The local path to download to.
        filelock: Whether to require a file lock before downloading, useful for
            multiple downloads to the same directory that may be happening in parallel.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: if (fs, fs_path) doesn't exist.
