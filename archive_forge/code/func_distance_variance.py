def distance_variance(x):
    """Distance variance.

    Calculate the empirical distance variance as described in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, 1-D or 2-D
        If `x` is 1-D than it is assumed to be a vector of observations of a
        single random variable. If `x` is 2-D than the rows should be
        observations and the columns are treated as the components of a
        random vector, i.e., each column represents a different component of
        the random vector `x`.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The empirical distance variance of `x`.
