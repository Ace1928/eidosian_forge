def refine_names(self, *names):
    """Refines the dimension names of :attr:`self` according to :attr:`names`.

        Refining is a special case of renaming that "lifts" unnamed dimensions.
        A ``None`` dim can be refined to have any name; a named dim can only be
        refined to have the same name.

        Because named tensors can coexist with unnamed tensors, refining names
        gives a nice way to write named-tensor-aware code that works with both
        named and unnamed tensors.

        :attr:`names` may contain up to one Ellipsis (``...``).
        The Ellipsis is expanded greedily; it is expanded in-place to fill
        :attr:`names` to the same length as ``self.dim()`` using names from the
        corresponding indices of ``self.names``.

        Python 2 does not support Ellipsis but one may use a string literal
        instead (``'...'``).

        Args:
            names (iterable of str): The desired names of the output tensor. May
                contain up to one Ellipsis.

        Examples::

            >>> imgs = torch.randn(32, 3, 128, 128)
            >>> named_imgs = imgs.refine_names('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')
            >>> named_imgs.names
            ('N', 'C', 'H', 'W')

            >>> tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
            >>> tensor = tensor.refine_names('A', ..., 'B', 'C')
            >>> tensor.names
            ('A', None, None, 'B', 'C')

        .. warning::
            The named tensor API is experimental and subject to change.
