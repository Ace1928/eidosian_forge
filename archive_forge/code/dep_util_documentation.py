Return true if 'target' is out-of-date with respect to any file
    listed in 'sources'.  In other words, if 'target' exists and is newer
    than every file in 'sources', return false; otherwise return true.
    'missing' controls what we do when a source file is missing; the
    default ("error") is to blow up with an OSError from inside 'stat()';
    if it is "ignore", we silently drop any missing source files; if it is
    "newer", any missing source files make us assume that 'target' is
    out-of-date (this is handy in "dry-run" mode: it'll make you pretend to
    carry out commands that wouldn't work because inputs are missing, but
    that doesn't matter because you're not actually going to run the
    commands).
