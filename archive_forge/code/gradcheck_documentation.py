Check gradients of gradients computed via small finite differences
    against analytical gradients wrt tensors in :attr:`inputs` and
    :attr:`grad_outputs` that are of floating point or complex type and with
    ``requires_grad=True``.

    This function checks that backpropagating through the gradients computed
    to the given :attr:`grad_outputs` are correct.

    The check between numerical and analytical gradients uses :func:`~torch.allclose`.

    .. note::
        The default values are designed for :attr:`input` and
        :attr:`grad_outputs` of double precision. This check will likely fail if
        they are of less precision, e.g., ``FloatTensor``.

    .. warning::
       If any checked tensor in :attr:`input` and :attr:`grad_outputs` has
       overlapping memory, i.e., different indices pointing to the same memory
       address (e.g., from :func:`torch.expand`), this check will likely fail
       because the numerical gradients computed by point perturbation at such
       indices will change values at all other indices that share the same
       memory address.

    Args:
        func (function): a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns
            a Tensor or a tuple of Tensors
        inputs (tuple of Tensor or Tensor): inputs to the function
        grad_outputs (tuple of Tensor or Tensor, optional): The gradients with
            respect to the function's outputs.
        eps (float, optional): perturbation for finite differences
        atol (float, optional): absolute tolerance
        rtol (float, optional): relative tolerance
        gen_non_contig_grad_outputs (bool, optional): if :attr:`grad_outputs` is
            ``None`` and :attr:`gen_non_contig_grad_outputs` is ``True``, the
            randomly generated gradient outputs are made to be noncontiguous
        raise_exception (bool, optional): indicating whether to raise an exception if
            the check fails. The exception gives more information about the
            exact nature of the failure. This is helpful when debugging gradchecks.
        nondet_tol (float, optional): tolerance for non-determinism. When running
            identical inputs through the differentiation, the results must either match
            exactly (default, 0.0) or be within this tolerance. Note that a small amount
            of nondeterminism in the gradient will lead to larger inaccuracies in
            the second derivative.
        check_undefined_grad (bool, optional): if True, check if undefined output grads
            are supported and treated as zeros
        check_batched_grad (bool, optional): if True, check if we can compute
            batched gradients using prototype vmap support. Defaults to False.
        fast_mode (bool, optional): if True, run a faster implementation of gradgradcheck that
            no longer computes the entire jacobian.
        masked (bool, optional): if True, the gradients of unspecified elements of
            sparse tensors are ignored (default, False).
    Returns:
        True if all differences satisfy allclose condition
