def _neighbor_switch(G, w, unsat, h_node_residual, avoid_node_id=None):
    """Releases one free stub for ``w``, while preserving joint degree in G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Graph in which the neighbor switch will take place.
    w : integer
        Node id for which we will execute this neighbor switch.
    unsat : set of integers
        Set of unsaturated node ids that have the same degree as w.
    h_node_residual: dictionary of integers
        Keeps track of the remaining stubs  for a given node.
    avoid_node_id: integer
        Node id to avoid when selecting w_prime.

    Notes
    -----
    First, it selects *w_prime*, an  unsaturated node that has the same degree
    as ``w``. Second, it selects *switch_node*, a neighbor node of ``w`` that
    is not  connected to *w_prime*. Then it executes an edge swap i.e. removes
    (``w``,*switch_node*) and adds (*w_prime*,*switch_node*). Gjoka et. al. [1]
    prove that such an edge swap is always possible.
