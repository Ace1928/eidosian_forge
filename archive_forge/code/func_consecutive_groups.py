def consecutive_groups(iterable, ordering=lambda x: x):
    """Yield groups of consecutive items using :func:`itertools.groupby`.
    The *ordering* function determines whether two items are adjacent by
    returning their position.

    By default, the ordering function is the identity function. This is
    suitable for finding runs of numbers:

        >>> iterable = [1, 10, 11, 12, 20, 30, 31, 32, 33, 40]
        >>> for group in consecutive_groups(iterable):
        ...     print(list(group))
        [1]
        [10, 11, 12]
        [20]
        [30, 31, 32, 33]
        [40]

    For finding runs of adjacent letters, try using the :meth:`index` method
    of a string of letters:

        >>> from string import ascii_lowercase
        >>> iterable = 'abcdfgilmnop'
        >>> ordering = ascii_lowercase.index
        >>> for group in consecutive_groups(iterable, ordering):
        ...     print(list(group))
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
        ['f', 'g']
        ['i']
        ['l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p']

    Each group of consecutive items is an iterator that shares it source with
    *iterable*. When an an output group is advanced, the previous group is
    no longer available unless its elements are copied (e.g., into a ``list``).

        >>> iterable = [1, 2, 11, 12, 21, 22]
        >>> saved_groups = []
        >>> for group in consecutive_groups(iterable):
        ...     saved_groups.append(list(group))  # Copy group elements
        >>> saved_groups
        [[1, 2], [11, 12], [21, 22]]
