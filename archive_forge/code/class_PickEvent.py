class PickEvent(Event):
    """
    A pick event.

    This event is fired when the user picks a location on the canvas
    sufficiently close to an artist that has been made pickable with
    `.Artist.set_picker`.

    A PickEvent has a number of special attributes in addition to those defined
    by the parent `Event` class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mouseevent : `MouseEvent`
        The mouse event that generated the pick.
    artist : `~matplotlib.artist.Artist`
        The picked artist.  Note that artists are not pickable by default
        (see `.Artist.set_picker`).
    other
        Additional attributes may be present depending on the type of the
        picked object; e.g., a `.Line2D` pick may define different extra
        attributes than a `.PatchCollection` pick.

    Examples
    --------
    Bind a function ``on_pick()`` to pick events, that prints the coordinates
    of the picked data point::

        ax.plot(np.rand(100), 'o', picker=5)  # 5 points tolerance

        def on_pick(event):
            line = event.artist
            xdata, ydata = line.get_data()
            ind = event.ind
            print(f'on pick line: {xdata[ind]:.3f}, {ydata[ind]:.3f}')

        cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('pick_event', on_pick)
