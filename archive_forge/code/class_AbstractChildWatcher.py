class AbstractChildWatcher:
    """Abstract base class for monitoring child processes.

    Objects derived from this class monitor a collection of subprocesses and
    report their termination or interruption by a signal.

    New callbacks are registered with .add_child_handler(). Starting a new
    process must be done within a 'with' block to allow the watcher to suspend
    its activity until the new process if fully registered (this is needed to
    prevent a race condition in some implementations).

    Example:
        with watcher:
            proc = subprocess.Popen("sleep 1")
            watcher.add_child_handler(proc.pid, callback)

    Notes:
        Implementations of this class must be thread-safe.

        Since child watcher objects may catch the SIGCHLD signal and call
        waitpid(-1), there should be only one active object per process.
