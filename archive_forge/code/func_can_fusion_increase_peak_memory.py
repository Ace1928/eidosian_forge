    """
        This function prevents fusion for nodes that can increase memory
        footprint. This problem is more common in horizontal fusion, where nodes
        that are far apart in the original order get fused, lengthening the live
        intervals of tensors. This is very evident in models with activation
        checkpointing, where the recomputed nodes from different checkpointed
        regions get fused and significantly increase the memory footprint.

        The current attempt is a quick, possibly hacky, heuristic to prevent the
        fusion of nodes that are far away in the original order.

        A better but difficult to implement heurisitic would be to use live
        intervals of the buffers, find region of peak pressure in the original
        program and prevent fusion that crosses that peak region. We might need
        special care or good approximation in this implementation, as fusion of
        node changes live intervals, and re-computing live intervals and peak
        memory after each fusion can introduce large compilation overhead.
