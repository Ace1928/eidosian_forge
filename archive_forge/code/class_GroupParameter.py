    Group parameters are used mainly as a generic parent item that holds (and groups!) a set
    of child parameters.

    It also provides a simple mechanism for displaying a button or combo
    that can be used to add new parameters to the group. To enable this, the group
    must be initialized with the 'addText' option (the text will be displayed on
    a button which, when clicked, will cause addNew() to be called). If the 'addList'
    option is specified as well, then a dropdown-list of addable items will be displayed
    instead of a button.
