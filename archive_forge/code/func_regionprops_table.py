    """Compute image properties and return them as a pandas-compatible table.

    The table is a dictionary mapping column names to value arrays. See Notes
    section below for details.

    .. versionadded:: 0.16

    Parameters
    ----------
    label_image : (M, N[, P]) ndarray
        Labeled input image. Labels with value 0 are ignored.
    intensity_image : (M, N[, P][, C]) ndarray, optional
        Intensity (i.e., input) image with same size as labeled image, plus
        optionally an extra dimension for multichannel data. The channel dimension,
        if present, must be the last axis. Default is None.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.18.0
            The ability to provide an extra dimension for channels was added.
    properties : tuple or list of str, optional
        Properties that will be included in the resulting dictionary
        For a list of available properties, please see :func:`regionprops`.
        Users should remember to add "label" to keep track of region
        identities.
    cache : bool, optional
        Determine whether to cache calculated properties. The computation is
        much faster for cached properties, whereas the memory consumption
        increases.
    separator : str, optional
        For non-scalar properties not listed in OBJECT_COLUMNS, each element
        will appear in its own column, with the index of that element separated
        from the property name by this separator. For example, the inertia
        tensor of a 2D region will appear in four columns:
        ``inertia_tensor-0-0``, ``inertia_tensor-0-1``, ``inertia_tensor-1-0``,
        and ``inertia_tensor-1-1`` (where the separator is ``-``).

        Object columns are those that cannot be split in this way because the
        number of columns would change depending on the object. For example,
        ``image`` and ``coords``.
    extra_properties : Iterable of callables
        Add extra property computation functions that are not included with
        skimage. The name of the property is derived from the function name,
        the dtype is inferred by calling the function on a small sample.
        If the name of an extra property clashes with the name of an existing
        property the extra property will not be visible and a UserWarning is
        issued. A property computation function must take a region mask as its
        first argument. If the property requires an intensity image, it must
        accept the intensity image as the second argument.
    spacing: tuple of float, shape (ndim,)
        The pixel spacing along each axis of the image.

    Returns
    -------
    out_dict : dict
        Dictionary mapping property names to an array of values of that
        property, one value per region. This dictionary can be used as input to
        pandas ``DataFrame`` to map property names to columns in the frame and
        regions to rows. If the image has no regions,
        the arrays will have length 0, but the correct type.

    Notes
    -----
    Each column contains either a scalar property, an object property, or an
    element in a multidimensional array.

    Properties with scalar values for each region, such as "eccentricity", will
    appear as a float or int array with that property name as key.

    Multidimensional properties *of fixed size* for a given image dimension,
    such as "centroid" (every centroid will have three elements in a 3D image,
    no matter the region size), will be split into that many columns, with the
    name {property_name}{separator}{element_num} (for 1D properties),
    {property_name}{separator}{elem_num0}{separator}{elem_num1} (for 2D
    properties), and so on.

    For multidimensional properties that don't have a fixed size, such as
    "image" (the image of a region varies in size depending on the region
    size), an object array will be used, with the corresponding property name
    as the key.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skimage import data, util, measure
    >>> image = data.coins()
    >>> label_image = measure.label(image > 110, connectivity=image.ndim)
    >>> props = measure.regionprops_table(label_image, image,
    ...                           properties=['label', 'inertia_tensor',
    ...                                       'inertia_tensor_eigvals'])
    >>> props  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS +SKIP
    {'label': array([ 1,  2, ...]), ...
     'inertia_tensor-0-0': array([  4.012...e+03,   8.51..., ...]), ...
     ...,
     'inertia_tensor_eigvals-1': array([  2.67...e+02,   2.83..., ...])}

    The resulting dictionary can be directly passed to pandas, if installed, to
    obtain a clean DataFrame:

    >>> import pandas as pd  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> data = pd.DataFrame(props)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> data.head()  # doctest: +SKIP
       label  inertia_tensor-0-0  ...  inertia_tensor_eigvals-1
    0      1         4012.909888  ...                267.065503
    1      2            8.514739  ...                  2.834806
    2      3            0.666667  ...                  0.000000
    3      4            0.000000  ...                  0.000000
    4      5            0.222222  ...                  0.111111

    [5 rows x 7 columns]

    If we want to measure a feature that does not come as a built-in
    property, we can define custom functions and pass them as
    ``extra_properties``. For example, we can create a custom function
    that measures the intensity quartiles in a region:

    >>> from skimage import data, util, measure
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> def quartiles(regionmask, intensity):
    ...     return np.percentile(intensity[regionmask], q=(25, 50, 75))
    >>>
    >>> image = data.coins()
    >>> label_image = measure.label(image > 110, connectivity=image.ndim)
    >>> props = measure.regionprops_table(label_image, intensity_image=image,
    ...                                   properties=('label',),
    ...                                   extra_properties=(quartiles,))
    >>> import pandas as pd # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> pd.DataFrame(props).head() # doctest: +SKIP
           label  quartiles-0  quartiles-1  quartiles-2
    0      1       117.00        123.0        130.0
    1      2       111.25        112.0        114.0

    3      4       111.00        111.5        112.5
    4      5       112.50        113.0        114.0
