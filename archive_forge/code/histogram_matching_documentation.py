Adjust an image so that its cumulative histogram matches that of another.

    The adjustment is applied separately for each channel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        Input image. Can be gray-scale or in color.
    reference : ndarray
        Image to match histogram of. Must have the same number of channels as
        image.
    channel_axis : int or None, optional
        If None, the image is assumed to be a grayscale (single channel) image.
        Otherwise, this parameter indicates which axis of the array corresponds
        to channels.

    Returns
    -------
    matched : ndarray
        Transformed input image.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Thrown when the number of channels in the input image and the reference
        differ.
