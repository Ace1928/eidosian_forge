Return the unique solutions of equations derived from
        ``expr`` by replacing ``t`` with ``+/- symbol``.

        Parameters
        ==========

        expr : Expr
            The expression which includes a dummy variable t to be
            replaced with +symbol and -symbol.

        symbol : Symbol
            The symbol for which a solution is being sought.

        Returns
        =======

        List of unique solution of the two equations generated by
        replacing ``t`` with positive and negative ``symbol``.

        Notes
        =====

        If ``expr = 2*log(t) + x/2` then solutions for
        ``2*log(x) + x/2 = 0`` and ``2*log(-x) + x/2 = 0`` are
        returned by this function. Though this may seem
        counter-intuitive, one must note that the ``expr`` being
        solved here has been derived from a different expression. For
        an expression like ``eq = x**2*g(x) = 1``, if we take the
        log of both sides we obtain ``log(x**2) + log(g(x)) = 0``. If
        x is positive then this simplifies to
        ``2*log(x) + log(g(x)) = 0``; the Lambert-solving routines will
        return solutions for this, but we must also consider the
        solutions for  ``2*log(-x) + log(g(x))`` since those must also
        be a solution of ``eq`` which has the same value when the ``x``
        in ``x**2`` is negated. If `g(x)` does not have even powers of
        symbol then we do not want to replace the ``x`` there with
        ``-x``. So the role of the ``t`` in the expression received by
        this function is to mark where ``+/-x`` should be inserted
        before obtaining the Lambert solutions.
