    Attributes
    ----------
    version : version of this Interface result object (a readonly property)
    interface : class type
        A copy of the `Interface` class that was run to generate this result.
    inputs :  a traits free representation of the inputs
    outputs : Bunch
        An `Interface` specific Bunch that contains all possible files
        that are generated by the interface.  The `outputs` are used
        as the `inputs` to another node when interfaces are used in
        the pipeline.
    runtime : Bunch

        Contains attributes that describe the runtime environment when
        the `Interface` was run.  Contains the attributes:

        * cmdline : The command line string that was executed
        * cwd : The directory the ``cmdline`` was executed in.
        * stdout : The output of running the ``cmdline``.
        * stderr : Any error messages output from running ``cmdline``.
        * returncode : The code returned from running the ``cmdline``.
