def swap_two_nodes(soln, seed):
    """Swap two nodes in `soln` to give a neighbor solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    soln : list of nodes
        Current cycle of nodes

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        The solution after move is applied. (A neighbor solution.)

    Notes
    -----
        This function assumes that the incoming list `soln` is a cycle
        (that the first and last element are the same) and also that
        we don't want any move to change the first node in the list
        (and thus not the last node either).

        The input list is changed as well as returned. Make a copy if needed.
