def solve_poly_system(seq, *gens, strict=False, **args):
    """
    Return a list of solutions for the system of polynomial equations
    or else None.

    Parameters
    ==========

    seq: a list/tuple/set
        Listing all the equations that are needed to be solved
    gens: generators
        generators of the equations in seq for which we want the
        solutions
    strict: a boolean (default is False)
        if strict is True, NotImplementedError will be raised if
        the solution is known to be incomplete (which can occur if
        not all solutions are expressible in radicals)
    args: Keyword arguments
        Special options for solving the equations.


    Returns
    =======

    List[Tuple]
        a list of tuples with elements being solutions for the
        symbols in the order they were passed as gens
    None
        None is returned when the computed basis contains only the ground.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import solve_poly_system
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    >>> solve_poly_system([x*y - 2*y, 2*y**2 - x**2], x, y)
    [(0, 0), (2, -sqrt(2)), (2, sqrt(2))]

    >>> solve_poly_system([x**5 - x + y**3, y**2 - 1], x, y, strict=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
