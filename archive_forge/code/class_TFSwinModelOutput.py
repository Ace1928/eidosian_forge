    Swin model's outputs that also contains a pooling of the last hidden states.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        pooler_output (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, hidden_size)`, *optional*, returned when `add_pooling_layer=True` is passed):
            Average pooling of the last layer hidden-state.
        hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each stage) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each stage) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
        reshaped_hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each stage) of shape
            `(batch_size, hidden_size, height, width)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs reshaped to
            include the spatial dimensions.
