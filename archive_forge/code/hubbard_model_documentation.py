The PREPARE operation optimized for the 2D Hubbard model.

    In contrast to the arbitrary chemistry Hamiltonian, we:
     - explicitly consider the two dimensions of indices to permit optimization of the circuits.
     - dispense with the `theta` parameter.

    The circuit for implementing $\textit{PREPARE}_{Hubbard}$ has a T-cost of $O(log(N)$
    and uses $O(1)$ single qubit rotations.

    Args:
        x_dim: the number of sites along the x axis.
        y_dim: the number of sites along the y axis.
        t: coefficient for hopping terms in the Hubbard model hamiltonian.
        mu: coefficient for single body Z term and two-body ZZ terms in the Hubbard model
            hamiltonian.

    Signature:
        control: A control bit for the entire gate.
        U: Whether we're applying the single-site part of the potential.
        V: Whether we're applying the pairwise part of the potential.
        p_x: First set of site indices, x component.
        p_y: First set of site indices, y component.
        alpha: First set of sites' spin indicator.
        q_x: Second set of site indices, x component.
        q_y: Second set of site indices, y component.
        beta: Second set of sites' spin indicator.
        target: The system register to apply the select operation.
        junk: Temporary Work space.
