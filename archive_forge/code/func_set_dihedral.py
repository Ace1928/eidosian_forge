        a3->a4 by changing the atom indexed by a4.

        If mask is not None, all the atoms described in mask
        (read: the entire subgroup) are moved. Alternatively to the mask,
        the indices of the atoms to be rotated can be supplied. If both
        *mask* and *indices* are given, *indices* overwrites *mask*.

        **Important**: If *mask* or *indices* is given and does not contain
        *a4*, *a4* will NOT be moved. In most cases you therefore want
        to include *a4* in *mask*/*indices*.

        Example: the following defines a very crude
        ethane-like molecule and twists one half of it by 30 degrees.
