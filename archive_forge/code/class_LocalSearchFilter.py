    Local Search Filters are used for fast neighbor pruning.
    Filtering a move is done in several phases:
    - in the Relax phase, filters determine which parts of their internals
      will be changed by the candidate, and modify intermediary State
    - in the Accept phase, filters check that the candidate is feasible,
    - if the Accept phase succeeds, the solver may decide to trigger a
      Synchronize phase that makes filters change their internal representation
      to the last candidate,
    - otherwise (Accept fails or the solver does not want to synchronize),
      a Revert phase makes filters erase any intermediary State generated by the
      Relax and Accept phases.
    A given filter has phases called with the following pattern:
    (Relax.Accept.Synchronize | Relax.Accept.Revert | Relax.Revert)*.
    Filters's Revert() is always called in the reverse order their Accept() was
    called, to allow late filters to use state done/undone by early filters'
    Accept()/Revert().
