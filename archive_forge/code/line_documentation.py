Select a cell to initiate _find_partition

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    starting_edge: an edge to build the starting cell from

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple of vertices in G

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If it is determined that G is not a line graph

    Notes
    -----
    If starting edge not specified then pick an arbitrary edge - doesn't
    matter which. However, this function may call itself requiring a
    specific starting edge. Note that the r, s notation for counting
    triangles is the same as in the Roussopoulos paper cited above.
