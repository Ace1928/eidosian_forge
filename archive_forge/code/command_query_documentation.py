Prints the results of a successful script job.

    This function is invoked only for successful script jobs.  Prints the output
    of each successful child job representing a statement to stdout.

    Child jobs representing expression evaluations are not printed, as are child
    jobs which failed, but whose error was handled elsewhere in the script.

    Depending on flags, the output is printed in either free-form or
    json style.

    Args:
      client: Bigquery client object
      job: json of the script job, expressed as a dictionary
