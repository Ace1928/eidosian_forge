    """Compile the source of a wrapped function

        Assemble and compile the decorated function, and intrusively replace its
        code with the compiled version's.  The thinly wrapped function becomes
        the decorated function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : callable
            A function returned by argmap.__call__ which is in the process
            of being called for the first time.

        Returns
        -------
        func : callable
            The same function, with a new __code__ object.

        Notes
        -----
        It was observed in NetworkX issue #4732 [1] that the import time of
        NetworkX was significantly bloated by the use of decorators: over half
        of the import time was being spent decorating functions.  This was
        somewhat improved by a change made to the `decorator` library, at the
        cost of a relatively heavy-weight call to `inspect.Signature.bind`
        for each call to the decorated function.

        The workaround we arrived at is to do minimal work at the time of
        decoration.  When the decorated function is called for the first time,
        we compile a function with the same function signature as the wrapped
        function.  The resulting decorated function is faster than one made by
        the `decorator` library, so that the overhead of the first call is
        'paid off' after a small number of calls.
