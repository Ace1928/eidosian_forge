Iterate over local bridges of `G` optionally computing the span

    A *local bridge* is an edge whose endpoints have no common neighbors.
    That is, the edge is not part of a triangle in the graph.

    The *span* of a *local bridge* is the shortest path length between
    the endpoints if the local bridge is removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph

    with_span : bool
        If True, yield a 3-tuple `(u, v, span)`

    weight : function, string or None (default: None)
        If function, used to compute edge weights for the span.
        If string, the edge data attribute used in calculating span.
        If None, all edges have weight 1.

    Yields
    ------
    e : edge
        The local bridges as an edge 2-tuple of nodes `(u, v)` or
        as a 3-tuple `(u, v, span)` when `with_span is True`.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is a directed graph or multigraph.

    Examples
    --------
    A cycle graph has every edge a local bridge with span N-1.

       >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(9)
       >>> (0, 8, 8) in set(nx.local_bridges(G))
       True
