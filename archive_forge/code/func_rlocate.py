def rlocate(iterable, pred=bool, window_size=None):
    """Yield the index of each item in *iterable* for which *pred* returns
    ``True``, starting from the right and moving left.

    *pred* defaults to :func:`bool`, which will select truthy items:

        >>> list(rlocate([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]))  # Truthy at 1, 2, and 4
        [4, 2, 1]

    Set *pred* to a custom function to, e.g., find the indexes for a particular
    item:

        >>> iterable = iter('abcb')
        >>> pred = lambda x: x == 'b'
        >>> list(rlocate(iterable, pred))
        [3, 1]

    If *window_size* is given, then the *pred* function will be called with
    that many items. This enables searching for sub-sequences:

        >>> iterable = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3]
        >>> pred = lambda *args: args == (1, 2, 3)
        >>> list(rlocate(iterable, pred=pred, window_size=3))
        [9, 5, 1]

    Beware, this function won't return anything for infinite iterables.
    If *iterable* is reversible, ``rlocate`` will reverse it and search from
    the right. Otherwise, it will search from the left and return the results
    in reverse order.

    See :func:`locate` to for other example applications.
