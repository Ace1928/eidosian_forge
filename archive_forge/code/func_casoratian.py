def casoratian(seqs, n, zero=True):
    """Given linear difference operator L of order 'k' and homogeneous
       equation Ly = 0 we want to compute kernel of L, which is a set
       of 'k' sequences: a(n), b(n), ... z(n).

       Solutions of L are linearly independent iff their Casoratian,
       denoted as C(a, b, ..., z), do not vanish for n = 0.

       Casoratian is defined by k x k determinant::

                  +  a(n)     b(n)     . . . z(n)     +
                  |  a(n+1)   b(n+1)   . . . z(n+1)   |
                  |    .         .     .        .     |
                  |    .         .       .      .     |
                  |    .         .         .    .     |
                  +  a(n+k-1) b(n+k-1) . . . z(n+k-1) +

       It proves very useful in rsolve_hyper() where it is applied
       to a generating set of a recurrence to factor out linearly
       dependent solutions and return a basis:

       >>> from sympy import Symbol, casoratian, factorial
       >>> n = Symbol('n', integer=True)

       Exponential and factorial are linearly independent:

       >>> casoratian([2**n, factorial(n)], n) != 0
       True
