        Hook called from template code to get the row or column stride of an arg.
        This is required by some CUTLASS 2.X APIs.
        If the node is in row_major, it returns stride[-2].
        If the node is in column_major, it returns stride[-1].

        TODO: Will add needed args to pass it in if it is dynamic.
