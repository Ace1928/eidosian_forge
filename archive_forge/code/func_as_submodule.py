        Represent this prime ideal as a :py:class:`~.Submodule`.

        Explanation
        ===========

        The :py:class:`~.PrimeIdeal` class serves to bundle information about
        a prime ideal, such as its inertia degree, ramification index, and
        two-generator representation, as well as to offer helpful methods like
        :py:meth:`~.PrimeIdeal.valuation` and
        :py:meth:`~.PrimeIdeal.test_factor`.

        However, in order to be added and multiplied by other ideals or
        rational numbers, it must first be converted into a
        :py:class:`~.Submodule`, which is a class that supports these
        operations.

        In many cases, the user need not perform this conversion deliberately,
        since it is automatically performed by the arithmetic operator methods
        :py:meth:`~.PrimeIdeal.__add__` and :py:meth:`~.PrimeIdeal.__mul__`.

        Raising a :py:class:`~.PrimeIdeal` to a non-negative integer power is
        also supported.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import Poly, cyclotomic_poly, prime_decomp
        >>> T = Poly(cyclotomic_poly(7))
        >>> P0 = prime_decomp(7, T)[0]
        >>> print(P0**6 == 7*P0.ZK)
        True

        Note that, on both sides of the equation above, we had a
        :py:class:`~.Submodule`. In the next equation we recall that adding
        ideals yields their GCD. This time, we need a deliberate conversion
        to :py:class:`~.Submodule` on the right:

        >>> print(P0 + 7*P0.ZK == P0.as_submodule())
        True

        Returns
        =======

        :py:class:`~.Submodule`
            Will be equal to ``self.p * self.ZK + self.alpha * self.ZK``.
