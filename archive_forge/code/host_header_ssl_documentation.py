from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter

    A HTTPS Adapter for Python Requests that sets the hostname for certificate
    verification based on the Host header.

    This allows requesting the IP address directly via HTTPS without getting
    a "hostname doesn't match" exception.

    Example usage:

        >>> s.mount('https://', HostHeaderSSLAdapter())
        >>> s.get("https://93.184.216.34", headers={"Host": "example.org"})
