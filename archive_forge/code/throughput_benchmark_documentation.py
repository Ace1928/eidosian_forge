import torch._C

        Run a benchmark on the module.

        Args:
            num_warmup_iters (int): Warmup iters are used to make sure we run a module
                a few times before actually measuring things. This way we avoid cold
                caches and any other similar problems. This is the number of warmup
                iterations for each of the thread in separate

            num_iters (int): Number of iterations the benchmark should run with.
                This number is separate from the warmup iterations. Also the number is
                shared across all the threads. Once the num_iters iterations across all
                the threads is reached, we will stop execution. Though total number of
                iterations might be slightly larger. Which is reported as
                stats.num_iters where stats is the result of this function

            profiler_output_path (str): Location to save Autograd Profiler trace.
                If not empty, Autograd Profiler will be enabled for the main benchmark
                execution (but not the warmup phase). The full trace will be saved
                into the file path provided by this argument


        This function returns BenchmarkExecutionStats object which is defined via pybind11.
        It currently has two fields:
            - num_iters - number of actual iterations the benchmark have made
            - avg_latency_ms - average time it took to infer on one input example in milliseconds
