def number_of_edges(self, u=None, v=None):
    """Returns the number of edges between two nodes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        u, v : nodes, optional (default=all edges)
            If u and v are specified, return the number of edges between
            u and v. Otherwise return the total number of all edges.

        Returns
        -------
        nedges : int
            The number of edges in the graph.  If nodes `u` and `v` are
            specified return the number of edges between those nodes. If
            the graph is directed, this only returns the number of edges
            from `u` to `v`.

        Examples
        --------
        For undirected graphs, this method counts the total number of
        edges in the graph:

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
        >>> G.number_of_edges()
        3

        If you specify two nodes, this counts the total number of edges
        joining the two nodes:

        >>> G.number_of_edges(0, 1)
        1

        For directed graphs, this method can count the total number of
        directed edges from `u` to `v`:

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
        >>> G.add_edge(0, 1)
        >>> G.add_edge(1, 0)
        >>> G.number_of_edges(0, 1)
        1
