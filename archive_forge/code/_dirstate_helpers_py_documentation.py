from .dirstate import DirState, DirstateCorrupt
Read in the dirblocks for the given DirState object.

    This is tightly bound to the DirState internal representation. It should be
    thought of as a member function, which is only separated out so that we can
    re-write it in pyrex.

    :param state: A DirState object.
    :return: None
