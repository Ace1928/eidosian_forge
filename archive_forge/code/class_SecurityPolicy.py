class SecurityPolicy(_messages.Message):
    """Represents a Google Cloud Armor security policy resource. Only external
  backend services that use load balancers can reference a security policy.
  For more information, see Google Cloud Armor security policy overview.

  Enums:
    TypeValueValuesEnum: The type indicates the intended use of the security
      policy. - CLOUD_ARMOR: Cloud Armor backend security policies can be
      configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services.
      They filter requests before they hit the origin servers. -
      CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE: Cloud Armor edge security policies can be configured
      to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services (including
      Cloud CDN-enabled) as well as backend buckets (Cloud Storage). They
      filter requests before the request is served from Google's cache. -
      CLOUD_ARMOR_INTERNAL_SERVICE: Cloud Armor internal service policies can
      be configured to filter HTTP requests targeting services managed by
      Traffic Director in a service mesh. They filter requests before the
      request is served from the application. - CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK: Cloud
      Armor network policies can be configured to filter packets targeting
      network load balancing resources such as backend services, target pools,
      target instances, and instances with external IPs. They filter requests
      before the request is served from the application. This field can be set
      only at resource creation time.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    adaptiveProtectionConfig: A SecurityPolicyAdaptiveProtectionConfig
      attribute.
    advancedOptionsConfig: A SecurityPolicyAdvancedOptionsConfig attribute.
    associations: A list of associations that belong to this policy.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    ddosProtectionConfig: A SecurityPolicyDdosProtectionConfig attribute.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    displayName: User-provided name of the organization security policy. The
      name should be unique in the organization in which the security policy
      is created. This should only be used when SecurityPolicyType is
      FIREWALL. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt. Specifically, the name must be
      1-63 characters long and match the regular expression
      `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a
      lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase
      letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
    fingerprint: Specifies a fingerprint for this resource, which is
      essentially a hash of the metadata's contents and used for optimistic
      locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
      changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You must
      always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change metadata, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to
      the security policy.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#securityPolicyfor
      security policies
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      security policy, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels. To see the latest fingerprint, make get() request to the
      security policy.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    parent: [Output Only] The parent of the security policy.
    recaptchaOptionsConfig: A SecurityPolicyRecaptchaOptionsConfig attribute.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional security policy
      resides. This field is not applicable to global security policies.
    ruleTupleCount: [Output Only] Total count of all security policy rule
      tuples. A security policy can not exceed a set number of tuples.
    rules: A list of rules that belong to this policy. There must always be a
      default rule which is a rule with priority 2147483647 and match all
      condition (for the match condition this means match "*" for srcIpRanges
      and for the networkMatch condition every field must be either match "*"
      or not set). If no rules are provided when creating a security policy, a
      default rule with action "allow" will be added.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    type: The type indicates the intended use of the security policy. -
      CLOUD_ARMOR: Cloud Armor backend security policies can be configured to
      filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services. They filter
      requests before they hit the origin servers. - CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE: Cloud
      Armor edge security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP
      requests targeting backend services (including Cloud CDN-enabled) as
      well as backend buckets (Cloud Storage). They filter requests before the
      request is served from Google's cache. - CLOUD_ARMOR_INTERNAL_SERVICE:
      Cloud Armor internal service policies can be configured to filter HTTP
      requests targeting services managed by Traffic Director in a service
      mesh. They filter requests before the request is served from the
      application. - CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK: Cloud Armor network policies can be
      configured to filter packets targeting network load balancing resources
      such as backend services, target pools, target instances, and instances
      with external IPs. They filter requests before the request is served
      from the application. This field can be set only at resource creation
      time.
    userDefinedFields: Definitions of user-defined fields for
      CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK policies. A user-defined field consists of up to 4
      bytes extracted from a fixed offset in the packet, relative to the IPv4,
      IPv6, TCP, or UDP header, with an optional mask to select certain bits.
      Rules may then specify matching values for these fields. Example:
      userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" base: IPV4 offset: 6
      size: 2 mask: "0x1fff"
