    Compute the bounding boxes around the provided masks.

    Returns a [N, 4] tensor containing bounding boxes. The boxes are in ``(x1, y1, x2, y2)`` format with
    ``0 <= x1 < x2`` and ``0 <= y1 < y2``.

    Args:
        masks (Tensor[N, H, W]): masks to transform where N is the number of masks
            and (H, W) are the spatial dimensions.

    Returns:
        Tensor[N, 4]: bounding boxes
