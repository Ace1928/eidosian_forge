    Count flops for convolution. Note only multiplication is
    counted. Computation for addition and bias is ignored.
    Flops for a transposed convolution are calculated as
    flops = (x_shape[2:] * prod(w_shape) * batch_size).
    Args:
        x_shape (list(int)): The input shape before convolution.
        w_shape (list(int)): The filter shape.
        out_shape (list(int)): The output shape after convolution.
