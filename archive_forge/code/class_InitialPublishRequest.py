        topic (str):

        partition (int):
            The partition within the topic to which messages will be

            be in the range [0, topic.num_partitions).

            Unique identifier for a publisher client. If
            set, enables publish idempotency within a
            publisher client session.

            bit uuid, generated by standard uuid algorithms
            like uuid1 or uuid4. The same identifier should
            be reused following disconnections with
            retryable stream errors.
