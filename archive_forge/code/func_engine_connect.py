    """Intercept the creation of a new :class:`_engine.Connection`.

        This event is called typically as the direct result of calling
        the :meth:`_engine.Engine.connect` method.

        It differs from the :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.connect` method, which
        refers to the actual connection to a database at the DBAPI level;
        a DBAPI connection may be pooled and reused for many operations.
        In contrast, this event refers only to the production of a higher level
        :class:`_engine.Connection` wrapper around such a DBAPI connection.

        It also differs from the :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.checkout` event
        in that it is specific to the :class:`_engine.Connection` object,
        not the
        DBAPI connection that :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.checkout` deals with,
        although
        this DBAPI connection is available here via the
        :attr:`_engine.Connection.connection` attribute.
        But note there can in fact
        be multiple :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.checkout`
        events within the lifespan
        of a single :class:`_engine.Connection` object, if that
        :class:`_engine.Connection`
        is invalidated and re-established.

        :param conn: :class:`_engine.Connection` object.

            :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.checkout`
            the lower-level pool checkout event
