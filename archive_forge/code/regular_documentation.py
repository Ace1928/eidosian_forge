Compute a k-factor of G

    A k-factor of a graph is a spanning k-regular subgraph.
    A spanning k-regular subgraph of G is a subgraph that contains
    each vertex of G and a subset of the edges of G such that each
    vertex has degree k.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
      Undirected graph

    matching_weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
       Used for finding the max-weighted perfect matching.
       If key not found, uses 1 as weight.

    Returns
    -------
    G2 : NetworkX graph
        A k-factor of G

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)])
    >>> G2 = nx.k_factor(G, k=1)
    >>> G2.edges()
    EdgeView([(1, 2), (3, 4)])
