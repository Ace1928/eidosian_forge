This is the full and final example from the Pygame Tutorial,
"How Do I Make It Move". It creates 10 objects and animates
them on the screen.

It also has a separate player character that can be controlled with arrow keys.

Note it's a bit scant on error checking, but it's easy to read. :]
Fortunately, this is python, and we needn't wrestle with a pile of
error codes.
