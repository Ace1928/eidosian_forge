def is_anti_symmetric(self, simplify=True):
    """Check if matrix M is an antisymmetric matrix,
        that is, M is a square matrix with all M[i, j] == -M[j, i].

        When ``simplify=True`` (default), the sum M[i, j] + M[j, i] is
        simplified before testing to see if it is zero. By default,
        the SymPy simplify function is used. To use a custom function
        set simplify to a function that accepts a single argument which
        returns a simplified expression. To skip simplification, set
        simplify to False but note that although this will be faster,
        it may induce false negatives.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import Matrix, symbols
        >>> m = Matrix(2, 2, [0, 1, -1, 0])
        >>> m
        Matrix([
        [ 0, 1],
        [-1, 0]])
        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric()
        True
        >>> x, y = symbols('x y')
        >>> m = Matrix(2, 3, [0, 0, x, -y, 0, 0])
        >>> m
        Matrix([
        [ 0, 0, x],
        [-y, 0, 0]])
        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric()
        False

        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
        >>> m = Matrix(3, 3, [0, x**2 + 2*x + 1, y,
        ...                   -(x + 1)**2, 0, x*y,
        ...                   -y, -x*y, 0])

        Simplification of matrix elements is done by default so even
        though two elements which should be equal and opposite would not
        pass an equality test, the matrix is still reported as
        anti-symmetric:

        >>> m[0, 1] == -m[1, 0]
        False
        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric()
        True

        If ``simplify=False`` is used for the case when a Matrix is already
        simplified, this will speed things up. Here, we see that without
        simplification the matrix does not appear anti-symmetric:

        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric(simplify=False)
        False

        But if the matrix were already expanded, then it would appear
        anti-symmetric and simplification in the is_anti_symmetric routine
        is not needed:

        >>> m = m.expand()
        >>> m.is_anti_symmetric(simplify=False)
        True
        """
