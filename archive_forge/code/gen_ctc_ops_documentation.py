Calculates the CTC Loss (log probability) for each batch entry.  Also calculates

  the gradient.  This class performs the softmax operation for you, so inputs
  should be e.g. linear projections of outputs by an LSTM.

  Args:
    inputs: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
      3-D, shape: `(max_time x batch_size x num_classes)`, the logits. Default blank
      label is 0 rather num_classes - 1.
    labels_indices: A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
      The indices of a `SparseTensor<int32, 2>`.
      `labels_indices(i, :) == [b, t]` means `labels_values(i)` stores the id for
      `(batch b, time t)`.
    labels_values: A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
      The values (labels) associated with the given batch and time.
    sequence_length: A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
      A vector containing sequence lengths (batch).
    preprocess_collapse_repeated: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
      Scalar, if true then repeated labels are
      collapsed prior to the CTC calculation.
    ctc_merge_repeated: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`.
      Scalar.  If set to false, *during* CTC calculation
      repeated non-blank labels will not be merged and are interpreted as
      individual labels.  This is a simplified version of CTC.
    ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs: An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.
      Scalar. If set to true, during CTC
      calculation, items that have longer output sequences than input sequences
      are skipped: they don't contribute to the loss term and have zero-gradient.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A tuple of `Tensor` objects (loss, gradient).

    loss: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
    gradient: A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
