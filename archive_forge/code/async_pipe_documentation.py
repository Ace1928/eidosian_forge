:class:`AsyncPipe` is a fairly transparent module wrapper. It doesn't
        modify the input and output signature of the underlying module. But
        there's type restriction. Input and output have to be a
        :class:`~torch.Tensor` or a tuple of tensors. This restriction is
        applied at partition boundaries too.

        Args:
            input (torch.Tensor or tensors): input mini-batch

        Returns:
            tensor or tensors: output mini-batch

        Raises:
            TypeError: input is not a tensor or tensors.
