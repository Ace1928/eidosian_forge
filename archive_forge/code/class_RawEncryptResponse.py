class RawEncryptResponse(_messages.Message):
    """Response message for KeyManagementService.RawEncrypt.

  Enums:
    ProtectionLevelValueValuesEnum: The ProtectionLevel of the
      CryptoKeyVersion used in encryption.

  Fields:
    ciphertext: The encrypted data. In the case of AES-GCM, the authentication
      tag is the tag_length bytes at the end of this field.
    ciphertextCrc32c: Integrity verification field. A CRC32C checksum of the
      returned RawEncryptResponse.ciphertext. An integrity check of ciphertext
      can be performed by computing the CRC32C checksum of ciphertext and
      comparing your results to this field. Discard the response in case of
      non-matching checksum values, and perform a limited number of retries. A
      persistent mismatch may indicate an issue in your computation of the
      CRC32C checksum. Note: This field is defined as int64 for reasons of
      compatibility across different languages. However, it is a non-negative
      integer, which will never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted
      to uint32 in languages that support this type.
    initializationVector: The initialization vector (IV) generated by the
      service during encryption. This value must be stored and provided in
      RawDecryptRequest.initialization_vector at decryption time.
    initializationVectorCrc32c: Integrity verification field. A CRC32C
      checksum of the returned RawEncryptResponse.initialization_vector. An
      integrity check of initialization_vector can be performed by computing
      the CRC32C checksum of initialization_vector and comparing your results
      to this field. Discard the response in case of non-matching checksum
      values, and perform a limited number of retries. A persistent mismatch
      may indicate an issue in your computation of the CRC32C checksum. Note:
      This field is defined as int64 for reasons of compatibility across
      different languages. However, it is a non-negative integer, which will
      never exceed 2^32-1, and can be safely downconverted to uint32 in
      languages that support this type.
    name: The resource name of the CryptoKeyVersion used in encryption. Check
      this field to verify that the intended resource was used for encryption.
    protectionLevel: The ProtectionLevel of the CryptoKeyVersion used in
      encryption.
    tagLength: The length of the authentication tag that is appended to the
      end of the ciphertext.
    verifiedAdditionalAuthenticatedDataCrc32c: Integrity verification field. A
      flag indicating whether
      RawEncryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data_crc32c was received by
      KeyManagementService and used for the integrity verification of
      additional_authenticated_data. A false value of this field indicates
      either that // RawEncryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data_crc32c
      was left unset or that it was not delivered to KeyManagementService. If
      you've set RawEncryptRequest.additional_authenticated_data_crc32c but
      this field is still false, discard the response and perform a limited
      number of retries.
    verifiedInitializationVectorCrc32c: Integrity verification field. A flag
      indicating whether RawEncryptRequest.initialization_vector_crc32c was
      received by KeyManagementService and used for the integrity verification
      of initialization_vector. A false value of this field indicates either
      that RawEncryptRequest.initialization_vector_crc32c was left unset or
      that it was not delivered to KeyManagementService. If you've set
      RawEncryptRequest.initialization_vector_crc32c but this field is still
      false, discard the response and perform a limited number of retries.
    verifiedPlaintextCrc32c: Integrity verification field. A flag indicating
      whether RawEncryptRequest.plaintext_crc32c was received by
      KeyManagementService and used for the integrity verification of the
      plaintext. A false value of this field indicates either that
      RawEncryptRequest.plaintext_crc32c was left unset or that it was not
      delivered to KeyManagementService. If you've set
      RawEncryptRequest.plaintext_crc32c but this field is still false,
      discard the response and perform a limited number of retries.
