Summarizes computed- vs sampled observations: MSE and (if applicable) images.

    Args:
        computed_float_obs_B_T_dims: Computed float observations
            (not clipped, not cast'd). Shape=(B, T, [dims ...]).
        sampled_obs_B_T_dims: Sampled observations (as-is from the environment, meaning
            this could be uint8, 0-255 clipped images). Shape=(B, T, [dims ...]).
        B: The batch size B (see shapes of `computed_float_obs_B_T_dims` and
            `sampled_obs_B_T_dims` above).
        T: The batch length T (see shapes of `computed_float_obs_B_T_dims` and
            `sampled_obs_B_T_dims` above).
        descr: A string used to describe the computed data to be used in the TB
            summaries.
