Queries the auxiliary graph for k-edge-connected subgraphs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        k : Integer
            Desired edge connectivity

        Returns
        -------
        k_edge_subgraphs : a generator of k-edge-subgraphs

        Notes
        -----
        Refines the k-edge-ccs into k-edge-subgraphs. The running time is more
        than $O(|V|)$.

        For single values of k it is faster to use `nx.k_edge_subgraphs`.
        But for multiple values of k, it can be faster to build AuxGraph and
        then use this method.
