        Main method to featurize and prepare for the model one or several sequence(s).

        Args:
            raw_speech (`np.ndarray`, `List[float]`, `List[np.ndarray]`, `List[List[float]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be padded. Each sequence can be a numpy array, a list of float
                values, a list of numpy arrays or a list of list of float values. Must be mono channel audio, not
                stereo, i.e. single float per timestep.
            sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*):
                The sampling rate at which the `raw_speech` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
                `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors.
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.
