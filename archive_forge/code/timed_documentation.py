Reverse of :meth:`dumps`, raises :exc:`.BadSignature` if the
        signature validation fails. If a ``max_age`` is provided it will
        ensure the signature is not older than that time in seconds. In
        case the signature is outdated, :exc:`.SignatureExpired` is
        raised. All arguments are forwarded to the signer's
        :meth:`~TimestampSigner.unsign` method.
