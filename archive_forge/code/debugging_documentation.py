    This class is intended to be used as a backend for `torch.compile`. It is
    composable with other backends. When used in this way, it accumulates
    information about graph breaks, ops, and other info and provides a string
    representation summarizing this information.

    Attributes:
        backend (str): The name of the backend to use for optimization.
        graphs (list): A list of the graphs captured by TorchDynamo.
        op_count (int): The total number of operations in all optimized graphs.
        break_reasons (list): A list of graph break reasons with stack traces.

    Example Usage:
        def fn(x):
            x = torch.sigmoid(x)
            return x

        torch._dynamo.reset()
        eb = ExplainWithBackend("inductor")
        optimized_fn = torch.compile(fn, backend=eb)
        result = optimized_fn(torch.randn(5))
        print(eb.output())
