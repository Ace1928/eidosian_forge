import networkx as nx
from networkx.exception import NetworkXError
Returns the Harary graph with given node connectivity and node number.

    The Harary graph $H_{k,n}$ is the graph that minimizes the number of
    edges needed with given node connectivity $k$ and node number $n$.

    This smallest number of edges is known to be ceil($kn/2$) [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k: integer
       The node connectivity of the generated graph

    n: integer
       The number of nodes the generated graph is to contain

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional Graph type
     to create (default=nx.Graph). If graph instance, then cleared
     before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX graph
        The Harary graph $H_{k,n}$.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm runs in $O(kn)$ time.
    It is implemented by following the Reference [2]_.
