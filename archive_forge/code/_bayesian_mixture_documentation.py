Estimate the lower bound of the model.

        The lower bound on the likelihood (of the training data with respect to
        the model) is used to detect the convergence and has to increase at
        each iteration.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)

        log_resp : array, shape (n_samples, n_components)
            Logarithm of the posterior probabilities (or responsibilities) of
            the point of each sample in X.

        log_prob_norm : float
            Logarithm of the probability of each sample in X.

        Returns
        -------
        lower_bound : float
