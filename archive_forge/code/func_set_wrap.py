        Set whether the text can be wrapped.

        wrap : bool

        Notes
        -----
        Wrapping does not work together with
        ``savefig(..., bbox_inches='tight')`` (which is also used internally
        by ``%matplotlib inline`` in IPython/Jupyter). The 'tight' setting
        rescales the canvas to accommodate all content and happens before
        wrapping.
