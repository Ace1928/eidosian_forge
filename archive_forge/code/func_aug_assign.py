def aug_assign(lhs, op, rhs):

    Create 'lhs op= rhs'.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Represents augmented variable assignment for code generation. This is a
    convenience function. You can also use the AugmentedAssignment classes
    directly, like AddAugmentedAssignment(x, y).

    Parameters
    ==========

    lhs : Expr
        SymPy object representing the lhs of the expression. These should be
        singular objects, such as one would use in writing code. Notable types
        include Symbol, MatrixSymbol, MatrixElement, and Indexed. Types that
        subclass these types are also supported.

    op : str
        Operator (+, -, /, \\*, %).

    rhs : Expr
        SymPy object representing the rhs of the expression. This can be any
        type, provided its shape corresponds to that of the lhs. For example,
        a Matrix type can be assigned to MatrixSymbol, but not to Symbol, as
        the dimensions will not align.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.codegen.ast import aug_assign
    >>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
    >>> aug_assign(x, '+', y)
    AddAugmentedAssignment(x, y)

    return augassign_classes[op](lhs, rhs)
