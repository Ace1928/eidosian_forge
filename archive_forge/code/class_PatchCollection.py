    Patches. It also makes it easier to assign a colormap to a heterogeneous

        Parameters
        ----------
        patches : list of `.Patch`
            A sequence of Patch objects.  This list may include
            a heterogeneous assortment of different patch types.

        match_original : bool, default: False
            If True, use the colors and linewidths of the original
            patches.  If False, new colors may be assigned by
            providing the standard collection arguments, facecolor,
            edgecolor, linewidths, norm or cmap.

        **kwargs
            All other parameters are forwarded to `.Collection`.

            If any of *edgecolors*, *facecolors*, *linewidths*, *antialiaseds*
            are None, they default to their `.rcParams` patch setting, in
            sequence form.

        Notes
        -----
        The use of `~matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable` functionality is optional.
        If the `~matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable` matrix ``_A`` has been set (via
        a call to `~.ScalarMappable.set_array`), at draw time a call to scalar
        mappable will be made to set the face colors.
