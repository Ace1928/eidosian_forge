        :param context: SubnetContext instance describing the new

            to the update_subnet call.

        Called after the transaction commits. Call can block, though
        will block the entire process so care should be taken to not
        drastically affect performance. Raising an exception will
        cause the deletion of the resource.

        update_subnet_postcommit is called for all changes to the
        subnet state.  It is up to the mechanism driver to ignore
        state or state changes that it does not know or care about.
