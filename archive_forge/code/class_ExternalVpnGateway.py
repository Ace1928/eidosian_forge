    """Represents an external VPN gateway. External VPN gateway is the on-
  premises VPN gateway(s) or another cloud provider's VPN gateway that
  connects to your Google Cloud VPN gateway. To create a highly available VPN
  from Google Cloud Platform to your VPN gateway or another cloud provider's
  VPN gateway, you must create a external VPN gateway resource with
  information about the other gateway. For more information about using
  external VPN gateways, see Creating an HA VPN gateway and tunnel pair to a
  peer VPN.

  Enums:
    RedundancyTypeValueValuesEnum: Indicates the user-supplied redundancy type
      of this external VPN gateway.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    interfaces: A list of interfaces for this external VPN gateway. If your
      peer-side gateway is an on-premises gateway and non-AWS cloud providers'
      gateway, at most two interfaces can be provided for an external VPN
      gateway. If your peer side is an AWS virtual private gateway, four
      interfaces should be provided for an external VPN gateway.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always
      compute#externalVpnGateway for externalVpnGateways.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      ExternalVpnGateway, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used
      for optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by
      Compute Engine and changes after every request to modify or update
      labels. You must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order
      to update or change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error
      412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request
      to retrieve an ExternalVpnGateway.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    redundancyType: Indicates the user-supplied redundancy type of this
      external VPN gateway.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.

    Values:
      FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY: The external VPN gateway has four public IP
        addresses; at the time of writing this API, the AWS virtual private
        gateway is an example which has four public IP addresses for high
        availability connections; there should be two VPN connections in the
        AWS virtual private gateway , each AWS VPN connection has two public
        IP addresses; please make sure to put two public IP addresses from one
        AWS VPN connection into interfaces 0 and 1 of this external VPN
        gateway, and put the other two public IP addresses from another AWS
        VPN connection into interfaces 2 and 3 of this external VPN gateway.
        When displaying highly available configuration status for the VPN
        tunnels connected to FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY external VPN gateway, Google
        will always detect whether interfaces 0 and 1 are connected on one
        interface of HA Cloud VPN gateway, and detect whether interfaces 2 and
        3 are connected to another interface of the HA Cloud VPN gateway.
      SINGLE_IP_INTERNALLY_REDUNDANT: The external VPN gateway has only one
        public IP address which internally provide redundancy or failover.
      TWO_IPS_REDUNDANCY: The external VPN gateway has two public IP addresses
        which are redundant with each other, the following two types of setup
        on your on-premises side would have this type of redundancy: (1) Two
        separate on-premises gateways, each with one public IP address, the
        two on-premises gateways are redundant with each other. (2) A single
        on-premise gateway with two public IP addresses that are redundant
