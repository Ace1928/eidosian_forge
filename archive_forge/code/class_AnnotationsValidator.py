Has an effect only if `text`\n                spans two or more lines (i.e. `text` contains\n                one or more <br> HTML tags) or if an explicit\n                width is set to override the text width.\n            arrowcolor\n                Sets the color of the annotation arrow.\n            arrowhead\n                Sets the end annotation arrow head style.\n            arrowside\n                Sets the annotation arrow head position.\n            arrowsize\n                Sets the size of the end annotation arrow head,\n                relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1\n                (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the\n                line.\n            arrowwidth\n                Sets the width (in px) of annotation arrow\n                line.\n            ax\n                Sets the x component of the arrow tail about\n                the arrow head (in pixels).\n            ay\n                Sets the y component of the arrow tail about\n                the arrow head (in pixels).\n            bgcolor\n                Sets the background color of the annotation.\n            bordercolor\n                Sets the color of the border enclosing the\n                annotation `text`.\n            borderpad\n                Sets the padding (in px) between the `text` and\n                the enclosing border.\n            borderwidth\n                Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing\n                the annotation `text`.\n            captureevents\n                Determines whether the annotation text box\n                captures mouse move and click events, or allows\n                those events to pass through to data points in\n                the plot that may be behind the annotation. By\n                default `captureevents` is False unless\n                `hovertext` is provided. If you use the event\n                `plotly_clickannotation` without `hovertext`\n                you must explicitly enable `captureevents`.\n            font\n                Sets the annotation text font.\n            height\n                Sets an explicit height for the text box. null\n                (default) lets the text set the box height.\n                Taller text will be clipped.\n            hoverlabel\n                :class:`plotly.graph_objects.layout.scene.annot\n                ation.Hoverlabel` instance or dict with\n                compatible properties\n            hovertext\n                Sets text to appear when hovering over this\n                annotation. If omitted or blank, no hover label\n                will appear.\n            name\n                When used in a template, named items are\n                created in the output figure in addition to any\n                items the figure already has in this array. You\n                can modify these items in the output figure by\n                making your own item with `templateitemname`\n                matching this `name` alongside your\n                modifications (including `visible: false` or\n                `enabled: false` to hide it). Has no effect\n                outside of a template.\n            opacity\n                Sets the opacity of the annotation (text +\n                arrow).\n            showarrow\n                Determines whether or not the annotation is\n                drawn with an arrow. If True, `text` is placed\n                near the arrow\'s tail. If False, `text` lines\n                up with the `x` and `y` provided.\n            standoff\n                Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end\n                arrowhead away from the position it is pointing\n                at, for example to point at the edge of a\n                marker independent of zoom. Note that this\n                shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay` vector,\n                in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves\n                everything by this amount.\n            startarrowhead\n                Sets the start annotation arrow head style.\n            startarrowsize\n                Sets the size of the start annotation arrow\n                head, relative to `arrowwidth`. A value of 1\n                (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the\n                line.\n            startstandoff\n                Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the start\n                arrowhead away from the position it is pointing\n                at, for example to point at the edge of a\n                marker independent of zoom. Note that this\n                shortens the arrow from the `ax` / `ay` vector,\n                in contrast to `xshift` / `yshift` which moves\n                everything by this amount.\n            templateitemname\n                Used to refer to a named item in this array in\n                the template. Named items from the template\n                will be created even without a matching item in\n                the input figure, but you can modify one by\n                making an item with `templateitemname` matching\n                its `name`, alongside your modifications\n                (including `visible: false` or `enabled: false`\n                to hide it). If there is no template or no\n                matching item, this item will be hidden unless\n                you explicitly show it with `visible: true`.\n            text\n                Sets the text associated with this annotation.\n                Plotly uses a subset of HTML tags to do things\n                like newline (<br>), bold (<b></b>), italics\n                (<i></i>), hyperlinks (<a href=\'...\'></a>).\n                Tags <em>, <sup>, <sub> <span> are also\n                supported.\n            textangle\n                Sets the angle at which the `text` is drawn\n                with respect to the horizontal.\n            valign\n                Sets the vertical alignment of the `text`\n                within the box. Has an effect only if an\n                explicit height is set to override the text\n                height.\n            visible\n                Determines whether or not this annotation is\n                visible.\n            width\n                Sets an explicit width for the text box. null\n                (default) lets the text set the box width.\n                Wider text will be clipped. There is no\n                automatic wrapping; use <br> to start a new\n                line.\n            x\n                Sets the annotation\'s x position.\n            xanchor\n                Sets the text box\'s horizontal position anchor\n                This anchor binds the `x` position to the\n                "left", "center" or "right" of the annotation.\n                For example, if `x` is set to 1, `xref` to\n                "paper" and `xanchor` to "right" then the\n                right-most portion of the annotation lines up\n                with the right-most edge of the plotting area.\n                If "auto", the anchor is equivalent to "center"\n                for data-referenced annotations or if there is\n                an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no\n                arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the\n                closest side.\n            xshift\n                Shifts the position of the whole annotation and\n                arrow to the right (positive) or left\n                (negative) by this many pixels.\n            y\n                Sets the annotation\'s y position.\n            yanchor\n                Sets the text box\'s vertical position anchor\n                This anchor binds the `y` position to the\n                "top", "middle" or "bottom" of the annotation.\n                For example, if `y` is set to 1, `yref` to\n                "paper" and `yanchor` to "top" then the top-\n                most portion of the annotation lines up with\n                the top-most edge of the plotting area. If\n                "auto", the anchor is equivalent to "middle"\n                for data-referenced annotations or if there is\n                an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no\n                arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the\n                closest side.\n            yshift\n                Shifts the position of the whole annotation and\n                arrow up (positive) or down (negative) by this\n                many pixels.\n            z\n                Sets the annotation\'s z position.\n'), **kwargs)
