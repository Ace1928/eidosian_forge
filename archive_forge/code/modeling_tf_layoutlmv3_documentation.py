        start_positions (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*):
            Labels for position (index) of the start of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
            Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
            are not taken into account for computing the loss.
        end_positions (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size,)`, *optional*):
            Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
            Positions are clamped to the length of the sequence (`sequence_length`). Position outside of the sequence
            are not taken into account for computing the loss.

        Returns:

        ```python
        >>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering
        >>> from datasets import load_dataset
        >>> import tensorflow as tf

        >>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutlmv3-base", apply_ocr=False)
        >>> model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained("microsoft/layoutlmv3-base")

        >>> question = "what's his name?"
        >>> words = example["tokens"]
        >>> boxes = example["bboxes"]

        >>> outputs = model(**encoding, start_positions=start_positions, end_positions=end_positions)
        >>> loss = outputs.loss
        >>> start_scores = outputs.start_logits
