        Bridge the runtime gap between the work factor supplied in `encoded`
        and the work factor suggested by this hasher.

        Taking PBKDF2 as an example, if `encoded` contains 20000 iterations and
        `self.iterations` is 30000, this method should run password through
        another 10000 iterations of PBKDF2. Similar approaches should exist
        for any hasher that has a work factor. If not, this method should be
        defined as a no-op to silence the warning.
