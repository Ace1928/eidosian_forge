    cvssVersion: CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and severity.
    details: Details of all known distros and packages affected by this
      vulnerability.
    severity: The note provider assigned severity of this vulnerability.
    sourceUpdateTime: The time this information was last changed at the
      source. This is an upstream timestamp from the underlying information
      source - e.g. Ubuntu security tracker.
    windowsDetails: Windows details get their own format because the
      information format and model don't match a normal detail. Specifically
      Windows updates are done as patches, thus Windows vulnerabilities really
      are a missing package, rather than a package being at an incorrect
      version.
