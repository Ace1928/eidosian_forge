Run the given sync function in the parent Trio thread, blocking until it
    is complete.

    Returns:
      Whatever ``fn(*args)`` returns.

    Returns or raises whatever the given function returns or raises. It
    can also raise exceptions of its own:

    Raises:
        RunFinishedError: if the corresponding call to `trio.run` has
            already completed.
        RuntimeError: if you try calling this from inside the Trio thread,
            which would otherwise cause a deadlock or if no ``trio_token`` was
            provided, and we can't infer one from context.
        TypeError: if ``fn`` is an async function.

    **Locating a TrioToken**: There are two ways to specify which
    `trio.run` loop to reenter:

        - Spawn this thread from `trio.to_thread.run_sync`. Trio will
          automatically capture the relevant Trio token and use it when you
          want to re-enter Trio.
        - Pass a keyword argument, ``trio_token`` specifying a specific
          `trio.run` loop to re-enter. This is useful in case you have a
          "foreign" thread, spawned using some other framework, and still want
          to enter Trio, or if you want to use a new system task to call ``fn``,
          maybe to avoid the cancellation context of a corresponding
          `trio.to_thread.run_sync` task.
