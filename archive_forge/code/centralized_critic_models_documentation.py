Multi-agent model that implements a centralized value function.

    It assumes the observation is a dict with 'own_obs' and 'opponent_obs', the
    former of which can be used for computing actions (i.e., decentralized
    execution), and the latter for optimization (i.e., centralized learning).

    This model has two parts:
    - An action model that looks at just 'own_obs' to compute actions
    - A value model that also looks at the 'opponent_obs' / 'opponent_action'
      to compute the value (it does this by using the 'obs_flat' tensor).
