def joinedload(self, attr: _AttrType, innerjoin: Optional[bool]=None) -> Self:
    """Indicate that the given attribute should be loaded using joined
        eager loading.

        This function is part of the :class:`_orm.Load` interface and supports
        both method-chained and standalone operation.

        examples::

            # joined-load the "orders" collection on "User"
            select(User).options(joinedload(User.orders))

            # joined-load Order.items and then Item.keywords
            select(Order).options(
                joinedload(Order.items).joinedload(Item.keywords)
            )

            # lazily load Order.items, but when Items are loaded,
            # joined-load the keywords collection
            select(Order).options(
                lazyload(Order.items).joinedload(Item.keywords)
            )

        :param innerjoin: if ``True``, indicates that the joined eager load
         should use an inner join instead of the default of left outer join::

            select(Order).options(joinedload(Order.user, innerjoin=True))

        In order to chain multiple eager joins together where some may be
        OUTER and others INNER, right-nested joins are used to link them::

            select(A).options(
                joinedload(A.bs, innerjoin=False).joinedload(
                    B.cs, innerjoin=True
                )
            )

        The above query, linking A.bs via "outer" join and B.cs via "inner"
        join would render the joins as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN (b JOIN c)". When
        using older versions of SQLite (< 3.7.16), this form of JOIN is
        translated to use full subqueries as this syntax is otherwise not
        directly supported.

        The ``innerjoin`` flag can also be stated with the term ``"unnested"``.
        This indicates that an INNER JOIN should be used, *unless* the join
        is linked to a LEFT OUTER JOIN to the left, in which case it
        will render as LEFT OUTER JOIN.  For example, supposing ``A.bs``
        is an outerjoin::

            select(A).options(
                joinedload(A.bs).joinedload(B.cs, innerjoin="unnested")
            )


        The above join will render as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN b LEFT OUTER JOIN c",
        rather than as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN (b JOIN c)".

        .. note:: The "unnested" flag does **not** affect the JOIN rendered
            from a many-to-many association table, e.g. a table configured as
            :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`, to the target table; for
            correctness of results, these joins are always INNER and are
            therefore right-nested if linked to an OUTER join.

        .. note::

            The joins produced by :func:`_orm.joinedload` are **anonymously
            aliased**. The criteria by which the join proceeds cannot be
            modified, nor can the ORM-enabled :class:`_sql.Select` or legacy
            :class:`_query.Query` refer to these joins in any way, including
            ordering. See :ref:`zen_of_eager_loading` for further detail.

            To produce a specific SQL JOIN which is explicitly available, use
            :meth:`_sql.Select.join` and :meth:`_query.Query.join`. To combine
            explicit JOINs with eager loading of collections, use
            :func:`_orm.contains_eager`; see :ref:`contains_eager`.
