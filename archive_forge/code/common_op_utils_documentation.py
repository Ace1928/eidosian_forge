        Handles ``__torch_function__`` dispatch for the default tensor ops that
        behave the same as ``torch.Tensor`` such as ``torch.Tensor.shape`` or
        ``torch.Tensor.dtype``. We simply lower to the real op call with
        DisableTorchFunctionSubclass context like ``torch.Tensor.__torch_function__``
        to avoid recursions.
