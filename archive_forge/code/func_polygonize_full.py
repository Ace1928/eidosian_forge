def polygonize_full(geometries, **kwargs):
    """Creates polygons formed from the linework of a set of Geometries and
    return all extra outputs as well.

    Polygonizes an array of Geometries that contain linework which
    represents the edges of a planar graph. Any type of Geometry may be
    provided as input; only the constituent lines and rings will be used to
    create the output polygons.

    This function performs the same polygonization as ``polygonize`` but does
    not only return the polygonal result but all extra outputs as well. The
    return value consists of 4 elements:

    * The polygonal valid output
    * **Cut edges**: edges connected on both ends but not part of polygonal output
    * **dangles**: edges connected on one end but not part of polygonal output
    * **invalid rings**: polygons formed but which are not valid

    This function returns the geometries within GeometryCollections.
    Individual geometries can be obtained using ``get_geometry`` to get
    a single geometry or ``get_parts`` to get an array of geometries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometries : array_like
        An array of geometries.
    axis : int
        Axis along which the geometries are polygonized.
        The default is to perform a reduction over the last dimension
        of the input array. A 1D array results in a scalar geometry.
    **kwargs
        See :ref:`NumPy ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>` for other keyword arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    (polygons, cuts, dangles, invalid)
        tuple of 4 GeometryCollections or arrays of GeometryCollections
