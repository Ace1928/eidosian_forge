    """Check equivalence between OpenFermion :class:`~.QubitOperator` and Pennylane VQE
    ``Hamiltonian`` (Tensor product of Pauli matrices).

    Equality is based on OpenFermion :class:`~.QubitOperator`'s equality.

    Args:
        openfermion_qubit_operator (QubitOperator): OpenFermion qubit operator represented as
            a Pauli summation
        pennylane_qubit_operator (pennylane.Hamiltonian): PennyLane
            Hamiltonian object
        wires (Wires, list, tuple, dict): Custom wire mapping used to convert to qubit operator
            from an observable terms measurable in a PennyLane ansatz.
            For types Wires/list/tuple, each item in the iterable represents a wire label
            corresponding to the qubit number equal to its index.
            For type dict, only int-keyed dict (for qubit-to-wire conversion) is accepted.
            If None, will map sorted wires from all Pennylane terms to consecutive int.

    Returns:
        (bool): True if equivalent
