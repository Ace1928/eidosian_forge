        Returns intrinsic impedance of the medium.

        Explanation
        ===========

        The intrinsic impedance of a medium is the ratio of the
        transverse components of the electric and magnetic fields
        of the electromagnetic wave travelling in the medium.
        In a region with no electrical conductivity it simplifies
        to the square root of ratio of magnetic permeability to
        electric permittivity.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy.physics.optics import Medium
        >>> m = Medium('m')
        >>> m.intrinsic_impedance
        149896229*pi*kilogram*meter**2/(1250000*ampere**2*second**3)
