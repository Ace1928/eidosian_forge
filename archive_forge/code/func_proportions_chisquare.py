    Test for proportions based on chisquare test

    Parameters
    ----------
    count : {int, array_like}
        the number of successes in nobs trials. If this is array_like, then
        the assumption is that this represents the number of successes for
        each independent sample
    nobs : int
        the number of trials or observations, with the same length as
        count.
    value : None or float or array_like

    Returns
    -------
    chi2stat : float
        test statistic for the chisquare test
    p-value : float
        p-value for the chisquare test
    (table, expected)
        table is a (k, 2) contingency table, ``expected`` is the corresponding
        table of counts that are expected under independence with given
        margins

    Notes
    -----
    Recent version of scipy.stats have a chisquare test for independence in
    contingency tables.

    This function provides a similar interface to chisquare tests as
    ``prop.test`` in R, however without the option for Yates continuity
    correction.

    count can be the count for the number of events for a single proportion,
    or the counts for several independent proportions. If value is given, then
    all proportions are jointly tested against this value. If value is not
    given and count and nobs are not scalar, then the null hypothesis is
    that all samples have the same proportion.
