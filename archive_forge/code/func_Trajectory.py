    Parameters:

    filename: str
        The name of the file.  Traditionally ends in .traj.
    mode: str
        The mode.  'r' is read mode, the file should already exist, and
        no atoms argument should be specified.
        'w' is write mode.  The atoms argument specifies the Atoms
        object to be written to the file, if not given it must instead
        be given as an argument to the write() method.
        'a' is append mode.  It acts as write mode, except that
        data is appended to a preexisting file.
    atoms: Atoms object
        The Atoms object to be written in write or append mode.
    properties: list of str
        If specified, these calculator properties are saved in the
        trajectory.  If not specified, all supported quantities are
        saved.  Possible values: energy, forces, stress, dipole,
        charges, magmom and magmoms.
    master: bool
        Controls which process does the actual writing. The
        default is that process number 0 does this.  If this
        argument is given, processes where it is True will write.

    The atoms, properties and master arguments are ignores in read mode.
