    """Register a function to run after each request to this object.

        The function is called with the response object, and must return
        a response object. This allows the functions to modify or
        replace the response before it is sent.

        If a function raises an exception, any remaining
        ``after_request`` functions will not be called. Therefore, this
        should not be used for actions that must execute, such as to
        close resources. Use :meth:`teardown_request` for that.

        This is available on both app and blueprint objects. When used on an app, this
        executes after every request. When used on a blueprint, this executes after
        every request that the blueprint handles. To register with a blueprint and
        execute after every request, use :meth:`.Blueprint.after_app_request`.
