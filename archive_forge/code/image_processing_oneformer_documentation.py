        Converts the output of [`MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentationOutput`] into image panoptic segmentation
        predictions. Only supports PyTorch.

        Args:
            outputs ([`MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentationOutput`]):
                The outputs from [`MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentation`].
            threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.5):
                The probability score threshold to keep predicted instance masks.
            mask_threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.5):
                Threshold to use when turning the predicted masks into binary values.
            overlap_mask_area_threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.8):
                The overlap mask area threshold to merge or discard small disconnected parts within each binary
                instance mask.
            label_ids_to_fuse (`Set[int]`, *optional*):
                The labels in this state will have all their instances be fused together. For instance we could say
                there can only be one sky in an image, but several persons, so the label ID for sky would be in that
                set, but not the one for person.
            target_sizes (`List[Tuple]`, *optional*):
                List of length (batch_size), where each list item (`Tuple[int, int]]`) corresponds to the requested
                final size (height, width) of each prediction in batch. If left to None, predictions will not be
                resized.

        Returns:
            `List[Dict]`: A list of dictionaries, one per image, each dictionary containing two keys:
            - **segmentation** -- a tensor of shape `(height, width)` where each pixel represents a `segment_id`, set
              to `None` if no mask if found above `threshold`. If `target_sizes` is specified, segmentation is resized
              to the corresponding `target_sizes` entry.
            - **segments_info** -- A dictionary that contains additional information on each segment.
                - **id** -- an integer representing the `segment_id`.
                - **label_id** -- An integer representing the label / semantic class id corresponding to `segment_id`.
                - **was_fused** -- a boolean, `True` if `label_id` was in `label_ids_to_fuse`, `False` otherwise.
                  Multiple instances of the same class / label were fused and assigned a single `segment_id`.
                - **score** -- Prediction score of segment with `segment_id`.
