  fix it.

  Enums:
    CvssVersionValueValuesEnum: Output only. CVSS version used to populate
      cvss_score and severity.
    EffectiveSeverityValueValuesEnum: The distro assigned severity for this
      vulnerability when that is available and note provider assigned severity
      when distro has not yet assigned a severity for this vulnerability. When
      there are multiple package issues for this vulnerability, they can have
      different effective severities because some might come from the distro
      and some might come from installed language packs (e.g. Maven JARs or Go
      binaries). For this reason, it is advised to use the effective severity
      on the PackageIssue level, as this field may eventually be deprecated.
      In the case where multiple PackageIssues have different effective
      severities, the one set here will be the highest severity of any of the
      PackageIssues.
    SeverityValueValuesEnum: Output only. The note provider assigned Severity
      of the vulnerability.

  Fields:
    cvssScore: Output only. The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score
      is on a scale of 0-10 where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates
      high severity.
    cvssV2: The CVSS v2 score of this vulnerability.
    cvssV3: The CVSS v3 score of this vulnerability.
    cvssVersion: Output only. CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and
      severity.
    effectiveSeverity: The distro assigned severity for this vulnerability
      when that is available and note provider assigned severity when distro
      has not yet assigned a severity for this vulnerability. When there are
      multiple package issues for this vulnerability, they can have different
      effective severities because some might come from the distro and some
      might come from installed language packs (e.g. Maven JARs or Go

      severities, the one set here will be the highest severity of any of the
      PackageIssues.
    extraDetails: Occurrence-specific extra details about the vulnerability.
    packageIssue: The set of affected locations and their fixes (if available)
      within the associated resource.
    severity: Output only. The note provider assigned Severity of the
      vulnerability.
    type: The type of package; whether native or non native(ruby gems, node.js
      packages etc). This may be deprecated in the future because we can have
      multiple PackageIssues with different package types.
    vexAssessment: VexAssessment provides all publisher provided Vex
      information that is related to this vulnerability for this resource.
