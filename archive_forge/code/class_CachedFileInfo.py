class CachedFileInfo:
    """Frozen data structure holding information about a single cached file.

    Args:
        file_name (`str`):
            Name of the file. Example: `config.json`.
        file_path (`Path`):
            Path of the file in the `snapshots` directory. The file path is a symlink
            referring to a blob in the `blobs` folder.
        blob_path (`Path`):
            Path of the blob file. This is equivalent to `file_path.resolve()`.
        size_on_disk (`int`):
            Size of the blob file in bytes.
        blob_last_accessed (`float`):
            Timestamp of the last time the blob file has been accessed (from any
            revision).
        blob_last_modified (`float`):
            Timestamp of the last time the blob file has been modified/created.

    <Tip warning={true}>

    `blob_last_accessed` and `blob_last_modified` reliability can depend on the OS you
    are using. See [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat_result)
    for more details.
