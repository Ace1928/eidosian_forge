def _backslashreplace_backport(ex):
    """Replace byte sequences that failed to decode with character escapes.

    Does the same thing as errors="backslashreplace" from Python 3.  Python 2
    lacks this functionality out of the box, so we need to backport it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ex: UnicodeDecodeError
        contains arguments of the string and start/end indexes of the bad portion.

    Returns
    -------
    text: unicode
        The Unicode string corresponding to the decoding of the bad section.
    end: int
        The index from which to continue decoding.

    Note
    ----
    Works on Py2 only.  Py3 already has backslashreplace built-in.
