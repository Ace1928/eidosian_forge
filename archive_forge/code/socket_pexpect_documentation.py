        Read from the file descriptor and return the result as a string.

        The read_nonblocking method of :class:`SpawnBase` assumes that a call
        to os.read will not block (timeout parameter is ignored). This is not
        the case for POSIX file-like objects such as sockets and serial ports.

        Use :func:`select.select`, timeout is implemented conditionally for
        POSIX systems.

        :param int size: Read at most *size* bytes.
        :param int timeout: Wait timeout seconds for file descriptor to be
            ready to read. When -1 (default), use self.timeout. When 0, poll.
        :return: String containing the bytes read
