Transforms the table values using provided callback and returns
        a new LUT with altered values.

        :param callback: A function which takes old lookup table values
                         and returns a new set of values. The number
                         of arguments which function should take is
                         ``self.channels`` or ``3 + self.channels``
                         if ``with_normals`` flag is set.
                         Should return a tuple of ``self.channels`` or
                         ``channels`` elements if it is set.
        :param with_normals: If true, ``callback`` will be called with
                             coordinates in the color cube as the first
                             three arguments. Otherwise, ``callback``
                             will be called only with actual color values.
        :param channels: The number of channels in the resulting lookup table.
        :param target_mode: Passed to the constructor of the resulting
                            lookup table.
