    A class which is numpy-like (e.g. Pint's Quantity) but not actually numpy

    The key is that it is not actually a numpy array so
    ``util.is_array(mock_numpy_like_array_instance)`` returns ``False``. Other
    important properties are that the class defines a :meth:`__iter__` method
    (so that ``isinstance(abc.Iterable)`` returns ``True``) and has a
    :meth:`ndim` property, as pandas special-cases 0-dimensional arrays in some
    cases.

    We expect pandas to behave with respect to such duck arrays exactly as
    with real numpy arrays. In particular, a 0-dimensional duck array is *NOT*
    a scalar (`is_scalar(np.array(1)) == False`), but it is not list-like either.
