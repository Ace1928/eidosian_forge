import cupy
Check state-space matrices and ensure they are 2-D.

    If enough information on the system is provided, that is, enough
    properly-shaped arrays are passed to the function, the missing ones
    are built from this information, ensuring the correct number of
    rows and columns. Otherwise a ValueError is raised.

        See `ss2tf` for format.

    Returns
    -------
    A, B, C, D : array
        Properly shaped state-space matrices.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If not enough information on the system was provided.
