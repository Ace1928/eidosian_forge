Solves the problem using the data output by the an apply invocation.

        The semantics are:

        .. code :: python

            data, inverse_data = solving_chain.apply(problem)
            solution = solving_chain.invert(solver_chain.solve_via_data(data, ...))

        which is equivalent to writing

        .. code :: python

            solution = solving_chain.solve(problem, ...)

        Parameters
        ----------
        problem : Problem
            The problem to solve.
        data : map
            Data for the solver.
        warm_start : bool
            Whether to warm start the solver.
        verbose : bool
            Whether to enable solver verbosity.
        solver_opts : dict
            Solver specific options.

        Returns
        -------
        raw solver solution
            The information returned by the solver; this is not necessarily
            a Solution object.
