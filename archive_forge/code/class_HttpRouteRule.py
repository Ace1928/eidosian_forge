class HttpRouteRule(_messages.Message):
    """The HttpRouteRule setting specifies how to match an HTTP request and the
  corresponding routing action that load balancing proxies perform.

  Fields:
    customErrorResponsePolicy: customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the
      Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor
      BackendBucket responds with an error. If a policy for an error code is
      not configured for the RouteRule, a policy for the error code configured
      in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is
      not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the
      policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes
      effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:
      - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies
      for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for
      the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a
      404 is encountered, the policy under
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response
      is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the
      pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for
      www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in
      RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests
      in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in
      conjunction with routeRules.routeAction.retryPolicy, retries take
      precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
      customErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load
      balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
      customErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service
      is returned to the client. customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only
      for global external Application Load Balancers.
    description: The short description conveying the intent of this routeRule.
      The description can have a maximum length of 1024 characters.
    headerAction: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
      to take effect for the selected backendService. The headerAction value
      specified here is applied before the matching
      pathMatchers[].headerAction and after pathMatchers[].routeRules[].routeA
      ction.weightedBackendService.backendServiceWeightAction[].headerAction
      HeaderAction is not supported for load balancers that have their
      loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL map is
      bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    httpFilterConfigs: Outbound route specific configuration for
      networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled by Traffic Director.
      httpFilterConfigs only applies for load balancers with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for
      more details. Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC
      proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
    httpFilterMetadata: Outbound route specific metadata supplied to
      networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled by Traffic Director.
      httpFilterMetadata only applies for load balancers with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for
      more details. The only configTypeUrl supported is
      type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Struct Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    matchRules: The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to
      this routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this
      routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates
      within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a
      matchRule must match for the request to match the rule.
    priority: For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines
      the order in which a load balancer interprets routeRules. RouteRules are
      evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The
      priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The
      first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot configure two
      or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must
      be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. Priority numbers can
      have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without
      affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16
      is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could add rules
      numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any
      impact on existing rules.
    routeAction: In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer
      performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header
      transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend.
      If routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not
      be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. URL maps for classic
      Application Load Balancers only support the urlRewrite action within a
      route rule's routeAction.
    service: The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if service is
      specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    urlRedirect: When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL
      specified by urlRedirect. If urlRedirect is specified, service or
      routeAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound to
      a target gRPC proxy.
