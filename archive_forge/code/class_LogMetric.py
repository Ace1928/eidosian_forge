class LogMetric(_messages.Message):
    """Describes a logs-based metric. The value of the metric is the number of
  log entries that match a logs filter in a given time interval.Logs-based
  metrics can also be used to extract values from logs and create a
  distribution of the values. The distribution records the statistics of the
  extracted values along with an optional histogram of the values as specified
  by the bucket options.

  Enums:
    VersionValueValuesEnum: Deprecated. The API version that created or
      updated this metric. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be
      changed.

  Messages:
    LabelExtractorsValue: Optional. A map from a label key string to an
      extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log entry
      field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the
      LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this
      map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the
      value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type
      defined in the label descriptor. If either the extraction or the type
      conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value
      for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and
      for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the
      maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are
      allowed in a project.

  Fields:
    bucketName: Optional. The resource name of the Log Bucket that owns the
      Log Metric. Only Log Buckets in projects are supported. The bucket has
      to be in the same project as the metric.For example:projects/my-
      project/locations/global/buckets/my-bucketIf empty, then the Log Metric
      is considered a non-Bucket Log Metric.
    bucketOptions: Optional. The bucket_options are required when the logs-
      based metric is using a DISTRIBUTION value type and it describes the
      bucket boundaries used to create a histogram of the extracted values.
    createTime: Output only. The creation timestamp of the metric.This field
      may not be present for older metrics.
    description: Optional. A description of this metric, which is used in
      documentation. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.
    disabled: Optional. If set to True, then this metric is disabled and it
      does not generate any points.
    filter: Required. An advanced logs filter
      (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters) which is
      used to match log entries. Example: "resource.type=gae_app AND
      severity>=ERROR" The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.
    labelExtractors: Optional. A map from a label key string to an extractor
      expression which is used to extract data from a log entry field and
      assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the
      LabelDescriptor must have an associated extractor expression in this
      map. The syntax of the extractor expression is the same as for the
      value_extractor field.The extracted value is converted to the type
      defined in the label descriptor. If either the extraction or the type
      conversion fails, the label will have a default value. The default value
      for a string label is an empty string, for an integer label its 0, and
      for a boolean label its false.Note that there are upper bounds on the
      maximum number of labels and the number of active time series that are
      allowed in a project.
    metricDescriptor: Optional. The metric descriptor associated with the
      logs-based metric. If unspecified, it uses a default metric descriptor
      with a DELTA metric kind, INT64 value type, with no labels and a unit of
      "1". Such a metric counts the number of log entries matching the filter
      expression.The name, type, and description fields in the
      metric_descriptor are output only, and is constructed using the name and
      description field in the LogMetric.To create a logs-based metric that
      records a distribution of log values, a DELTA metric kind with a
      DISTRIBUTION value type must be used along with a value_extractor
      expression in the LogMetric.Each label in the metric descriptor must
      have a matching label name as the key and an extractor expression as the
      value in the label_extractors map.The metric_kind and value_type fields
      in the metric_descriptor cannot be updated once initially configured.
      New labels can be added in the metric_descriptor, but existing labels
      cannot be modified except for their description.
    name: Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples:
      "error_count", "nginx/requests".Metric identifiers are limited to 100
      characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
      and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character
      (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first
      character of the name.This field is the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric
      resource name in the format "projects/PROJECT_ID/metrics/METRIC_ID".
      Example: If the resource name of a metric is "projects/my-
      project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests", this field's value is
      "nginx/requests".
    updateTime: Output only. The last update timestamp of the metric.This
      field may not be present for older metrics.
    valueExtractor: Optional. A value_extractor is required when using a
      distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to record from a
      log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction:
      EXTRACT(field) or REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The arguments are:
      field: The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be
      extracted. regex: A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
      (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group
      to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the
      field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error
      to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.The
      result of the extraction must be convertible to a double type, as the
      distribution always records double values. If either the extraction or
      the conversion to double fails, then those values are not recorded in
      the distribution.Example: REGEXP_EXTRACT(jsonPayload.request,
      ".*quantity=(\\d+).*")
    version: Deprecated. The API version that created or updated this metric.
      The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.
