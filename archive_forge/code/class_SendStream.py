    The underlying stream may be unidirectional, or bidirectional. If it's
    bidirectional, then you probably want to also implement
    :class:`ReceiveStream`, which makes your object a :class:`Stream`.

    :class:`SendStream` objects also implement the :class:`AsyncResource`
    interface, so they can be closed by calling :meth:`~AsyncResource.aclose`
    or using an ``async with`` block.

    If you want to send Python objects rather than raw bytes, see
    :class:`SendChannel`.

        Most low-level operations in Trio provide a guarantee: if they raise
        :exc:`trio.Cancelled`, this means that they had no effect, so the
        system remains in a known state. This is **not true** for
        :meth:`send_all`. If this operation raises :exc:`trio.Cancelled` (or
        any other exception for that matter), then it may have sent some, all,
        or none of the requested data, and there is no way to know which.

        This method may return early: it's possible that after it returns,
        :meth:`send_all` will still block. (In the worst case, if no better
        implementation is available, then it might always return immediately
        without blocking. It's nice to do better than that when possible,
        though.)

        This method **must not** return *late*: if it's possible for
        :meth:`send_all` to complete without blocking, then it must
        return. When implementing it, err on the side of returning early.

        Raises:
          trio.BusyResourceError: if another task is already executing a
              :meth:`send_all`, :meth:`wait_send_all_might_not_block`, or

        Note:

          This method is intended to aid in implementing protocols that want
          to delay choosing which data to send until the last moment. E.g.,
          suppose you're working on an implementation of a remote display server
          like `VNC
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing>`__, and
          the network connection is currently backed up so that if you call
          :meth:`send_all` now then it will sit for 0.5 seconds before actually
          sending anything. In this case it doesn't make sense to take a
          screenshot, then wait 0.5 seconds, and then send it, because the
          screen will keep changing while you wait; it's better to wait 0.5
          seconds, then take the screenshot, and then send it, because this
          way the data you deliver will be more
          up-to-date. Using :meth:`wait_send_all_might_not_block` makes it
          possible to implement the better strategy.

          If you use this method, you might also want to read up on
          ``TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT``.
