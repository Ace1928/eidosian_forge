        Headers are folded using the Header folding algorithm, which preserves
        existing line breaks in the value, and wraps each resulting line to the
        max_line_length.  If cte_type is 7bit, non-ascii binary data is CTE
        encoded using the unknown-8bit charset.  Otherwise the original source
        header is used, with its existing line breaks and/or binary data.
