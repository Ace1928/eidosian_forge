    """A sparse matrix state vector simulator that uses numpy.

    This simulator can be applied on circuits that are made up of operations
    that have a `_unitary_` method, or `_has_unitary_` and
    `_apply_unitary_`, `_mixture_` methods, are measurements, or support a
    `_decompose_` method that returns operations satisfying these same
    conditions. That is to say, the operations should follow the
    `cirq.SupportsConsistentApplyUnitary` protocol, the `cirq.SupportsUnitary`
    protocol, the `cirq.SupportsMixture` protocol, or the
    `cirq.SupportsDecompose` protocol. It is also permitted for the circuit
    to contain measurements which are operations that support
    `cirq.SupportsKraus` and `cirq.SupportsMeasurementKey`

    This can run simulations which mimic use of actual quantum hardware.
    These simulations do not give access to the state vector (like actual
    hardware).  There are two variations of run methods, one which takes in a
    single (optional) way to resolve parameterized circuits, and a second which
    takes in a list or sweep of parameter resolvers:

        run(circuit, param_resolver, repetitions)

        run_sweep(circuit, params, repetitions)

    The simulation performs optimizations if the number of repetitions is
    greater than one and all measurements in the circuit are terminal (at the
    end of the circuit). These methods return `Result`s which contain both
    the measurement results, but also the parameters used for the parameterized
    circuit operations. The initial state of a run is always the all 0s state
    in the computational basis.

    By contrast, the simulate methods of the simulator give access to the
    state vector of the simulation at the end of the simulation of the circuit.
    These methods take in two parameters that the run methods do not: a
    qubit order and an initial state. The qubit order is necessary because an
    ordering must be chosen for the kronecker product (see
    `DensityMatrixTrialResult` for details of this ordering). The initial
    state can be either the full state vector, or an integer which represents
    the initial state of being in a computational basis state for the binary
    representation of that integer. Similar to run methods, there are two
    simulate methods that run for single runs or for sweeps across different
    parameters:

        simulate(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order, initial_state)

        simulate_sweep(circuit, params, qubit_order, initial_state)

    The simulate methods, in contrast to the run methods, do not perform
    repetitions. The result of these simulations is a
    `SimulationTrialResult` which contains measurement
    results, information about parameters used in the simulation, and
    access to the state via the `state` method and
    `cirq.sim.state_vector.StateVectorMixin` methods.

    If one wishes to perform simulations that have access to the
    state vector as one steps through running the circuit, there is a generator
    which can be iterated over.  Each step is an object that gives access
    to the state vector.  This stepping through a `Circuit` is done on a
    `Moment` by `Moment` manner.

        simulate_moment_steps(circuit, param_resolver, qubit_order,
                              initial_state)

    One can iterate over the moments with the following (replace 'sim'
    with your `Simulator` object):

        for step_result in sim.simulate_moment_steps(circuit):
           # do something with the state vector via step_result.state_vector

    Note also that simulations can be stochastic, i.e. return different results
    for different runs.  The first version of this occurs for measurements,
    where the results of the measurement are recorded.  This can also
    occur when the circuit has mixtures of unitaries.

    If only the expectation values for some observables on the final state are
    required, there are methods for that as well. These methods take a mapping
    of names to observables, and return a map (or list of maps) of those names
    to the corresponding expectation values.

        simulate_expectation_values(circuit, observables, param_resolver,
                                    qubit_order, initial_state,
                                    permit_terminal_measurements)

        simulate_expectation_values_sweep(circuit, observables, params,
                                          qubit_order, initial_state,
                                          permit_terminal_measurements)

    Expectation values generated by these methods are exact (up to precision of
    the floating-point type used); the closest analogy on hardware requires
    estimating the expectation values from several samples.

    See `Simulator` for the definitions of the supported methods.
