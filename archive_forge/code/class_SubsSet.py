    Stores (expr, dummy) pairs, and how to rewrite expr-s.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The gruntz algorithm needs to rewrite certain expressions in term of a new
    variable w. We cannot use subs, because it is just too smart for us. For
    example::

        > Omega=[exp(exp(_p - exp(-_p))/(1 - 1/_p)), exp(exp(_p))]
        > O2=[exp(-exp(_p) + exp(-exp(-_p))*exp(_p)/(1 - 1/_p))/_w, 1/_w]
        > e = exp(exp(_p - exp(-_p))/(1 - 1/_p)) - exp(exp(_p))
        > e.subs(Omega[0],O2[0]).subs(Omega[1],O2[1])
        -1/w + exp(exp(p)*exp(-exp(-p))/(1 - 1/p))

    is really not what we want!

    So we do it the hard way and keep track of all the things we potentially
    want to substitute by dummy variables. Consider the expression::

        exp(x - exp(-x)) + exp(x) + x.

    The mrv set is {exp(x), exp(-x), exp(x - exp(-x))}.
    We introduce corresponding dummy variables d1, d2, d3 and rewrite::

        d3 + d1 + x.

    This class first of all keeps track of the mapping expr->variable, i.e.
    will at this stage be a dictionary::

        {exp(x): d1, exp(-x): d2, exp(x - exp(-x)): d3}.

    [It turns out to be more convenient this way round.]
    But sometimes expressions in the mrv set have other expressions from the
    mrv set as subexpressions, and we need to keep track of that as well. In
    this case, d3 is really exp(x - d2), so rewrites at this stage is::

        {d3: exp(x-d2)}.

    The function rewrite uses all this information to correctly rewrite our
    expression in terms of w. In this case w can be chosen to be exp(-x),
    i.e. d2. The correct rewriting then is::

        exp(-w)/w + 1/w + x.
