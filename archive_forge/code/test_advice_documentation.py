Tests for advice

This module was adapted from 'protocols.tests.advice', part of the Python
Enterprise Application Kit (PEAK).  Please notify the PEAK authors
(pje@telecommunity.com and tsarna@sarna.org) if bugs are found or
Zope-specific changes are required, so that the PEAK version of this module
can be kept in sync.

PEAK is a Python application framework that interoperates with (but does
not require) Zope 3 and Twisted.  It provides tools for manipulating UML
models, object-relational persistence, aspect-oriented programming, and more.
Visit the PEAK home page at http://peak.telecommunity.com for more information.
