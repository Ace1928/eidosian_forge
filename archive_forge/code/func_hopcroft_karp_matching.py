def hopcroft_karp_matching(G, top_nodes=None):
    """Returns the maximum cardinality matching of the bipartite graph `G`.

    A matching is a set of edges that do not share any nodes. A maximum
    cardinality matching is a matching with the most edges possible. It
    is not always unique. Finding a matching in a bipartite graph can be
    treated as a networkx flow problem.

    The functions ``hopcroft_karp_matching`` and ``maximum_matching``
    are aliases of the same function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

      Undirected bipartite graph

    top_nodes : container of nodes

      Container with all nodes in one bipartite node set. If not supplied
      it will be computed. But if more than one solution exists an exception
      will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    matches : dictionary

      The matching is returned as a dictionary, `matches`, such that
      ``matches[v] == w`` if node `v` is matched to node `w`. Unmatched
      nodes do not occur as a key in `matches`.

    Raises
    ------
    AmbiguousSolution
      Raised if the input bipartite graph is disconnected and no container
      with all nodes in one bipartite set is provided. When determining
      the nodes in each bipartite set more than one valid solution is
      possible if the input graph is disconnected.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is implemented with the `Hopcroft--Karp matching algorithm
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm>`_ for
    bipartite graphs.

    See :mod:`bipartite documentation <networkx.algorithms.bipartite>`
    for further details on how bipartite graphs are handled in NetworkX.
