    Determine output sharding and tensor shape based on given global tensor shape and input sharding.

    Takes as input the global shape of the tensor, and the input sharding,
    and produce corresponding output sharding and shape of the output tensor.

    Sharding propagation follows mapped dimensions:
    - An output dimension that maps directly to an input dimension is sharded equally
    - An output dimension that is a flattened set of input dimensions can only be
      sharded if only the leftmost flattened dimension is sharded.
    - An output dimension that is a split of the input dimension can only be sharded
      if the leftmost split size is divisible by the mesh dimension
