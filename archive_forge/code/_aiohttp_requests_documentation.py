Implementation of Authorized Session aiohttp request.

        Args:
            method (str):
                The http request method used (e.g. GET, PUT, DELETE)
            url (str):
                The url at which the http request is sent.
            data (Optional[dict]): Dictionary, list of tuples, bytes, or file-like
                object to send in the body of the Request.
            headers (Optional[dict]): Dictionary of HTTP Headers to send with the
                Request.
            timeout (Optional[Union[float, aiohttp.ClientTimeout]]):
                The amount of time in seconds to wait for the server response
                with each individual request. Can also be passed as an
                ``aiohttp.ClientTimeout`` object.
            max_allowed_time (Optional[float]):
                If the method runs longer than this, a ``Timeout`` exception is
                automatically raised. Unlike the ``timeout`` parameter, this
                value applies to the total method execution time, even if
                multiple requests are made under the hood.

                Mind that it is not guaranteed that the timeout error is raised
                at ``max_allowed_time``. It might take longer, for example, if
                an underlying request takes a lot of time, but the request
                itself does not timeout, e.g. if a large file is being
                transmitted. The timout error will be raised after such
                request completes.
