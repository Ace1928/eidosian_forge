    Logs information about the results of the code in generate_model_graph

    This function takes in the same Pyomo model as generate_model_graph and the model_graph generated by
    generate_model_graph (which is a NetworkX graph of nodes and edges based on the Pyomo model). Then, some relevant
    information about the model and model_graph is determined and logged using the logger.

    This function is designed to be called by generate_model_graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: Block
         the Pyomo model or block to be used for community detection
    model_graph: NetworkX graph
        a NetworkX graph with nodes and edges based on the given Pyomo optimization model
    constraint_set: set
        a set of the numbers that correspond to all of the constraints in the given model
    type_of_graph: str
        a string that specifies the type of graph that is created from the model
        'c' creates a graph based on constraint nodes,
        'v' creates a graph based on variable nodes,
        'b' creates a graph based on constraint and variable nodes (bipartite graph).
    with_objective: bool
        a Boolean argument that specifies whether or not the objective function is included in the graph

    Returns
    -------
    This function returns nothing; it simply logs information that is relevant to the user.
