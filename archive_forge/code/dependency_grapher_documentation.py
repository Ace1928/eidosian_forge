**1.7 Module Dependency Visualizer (`dependency_grapher.py`):**
- **Purpose:** This module is meticulously crafted to construct and render visual representations of dependency graphs for Python script components. Its primary objective is to provide a clear, detailed, and comprehensive visualization of interdependencies among modules, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of module interactions within a software system. This module aims to enhance the clarity and comprehension of software architecture through precise and detailed graphical representations.

- **Functions:**
  - `create_and_display_dependency_graph(import_statements)`: This function is engineered with the highest level of precision to generate a graph that accurately delineates the dependencies among modules based on the provided import statements. It ensures that each node (representing a module) and each edge (representing the dependency between modules) in the graph is depicted with absolute accuracy and clarity. The function adheres to rigorous standards of graphical representation, ensuring that the visual output is both informative and precise. This method employs advanced graph construction algorithms and leverages high-performance graphical rendering techniques to produce a visually appealing and technically accurate dependency graph. The function is structured to ensure modularity by focusing solely on the creation and display of the dependency graph, adhering to the principles of high cohesion and loose coupling. Each step in the graph construction and rendering process is clearly defined and meticulously implemented to ensure that all interactions and dependencies are accurately represented. The function utilizes an iterative development approach, where the graph representation is progressively refined to achieve the highest quality and functionality. Dependency management is handled with utmost care to ensure seamless integration and avoid conflicts. The function preserves and enhances existing functionality while avoiding redundancy and duplication, striving for the highest possible quality in every aspect of the code, including functionality, performance, and maintainability.
