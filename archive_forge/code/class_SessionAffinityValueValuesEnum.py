    instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy. CLIENT_IP_PROTO:
    Connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to
    the same instance in the pool while that instance remains healthy.

    Values:
      CLIENT_IP: 2-tuple hash on packet's source and destination IP addresses.
        Connections from the same source IP address to the same destination IP
        address will be served by the same backend VM while that VM remains
        healthy.
      CLIENT_IP_NO_DESTINATION: 1-tuple hash only on packet's source IP
        address. Connections from the same source IP address will be served by
        the same backend VM while that VM remains healthy. This option can
        only be used for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing.
      CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO: 5-tuple hash on packet's source and destination IP
        addresses, IP protocol, and source and destination ports. Connections
        for the same IP protocol from the same source IP address and port to
        the same destination IP address and port will be served by the same
        backend VM while that VM remains healthy. This option cannot be used
        for HTTP(S) load balancing.
      CLIENT_IP_PROTO: 3-tuple hash on packet's source and destination IP
        addresses, and IP protocol. Connections for the same IP protocol from
        the same source IP address to the same destination IP address will be
        served by the same backend VM while that VM remains healthy. This
        option cannot be used for HTTP(S) load balancing.
      GENERATED_COOKIE: Hash based on a cookie generated by the L7
        loadbalancer. Only valid for HTTP(S) load balancing.
      HEADER_FIELD: The hash is based on a user specified header field.
      HTTP_COOKIE: The hash is based on a user provided cookie.
      NONE: No session affinity. Connections from the same client IP may go to
        any instance in the pool.
