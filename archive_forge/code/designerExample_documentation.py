Simple example of loading UI template created with Qt Designer.

This example uses uic.loadUiType to parse and load the ui at runtime. It is also
possible to pre-compile the .ui file using pyuic (see VideoSpeedTest and 
ScatterPlotSpeedTest examples; these .ui files have been compiled with the
tools/rebuildUi.py script).
