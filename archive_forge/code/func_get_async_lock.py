    """
        Create a new Lock instance named ``name`` using the Redis client
        supplied by ``keydb``.

        ``timeout`` indicates a maximum life for the lock in seconds.
        By default, it will remain locked until release() is called.
        ``timeout`` can be specified as a float or integer, both representing
        the number of seconds to wait.

        ``sleep`` indicates the amount of time to sleep in seconds per loop
        iteration when the lock is in blocking mode and another client is
        currently holding the lock.

        ``blocking`` indicates whether calling ``acquire`` should block until
        the lock has been acquired or to fail immediately, causing ``acquire``
        to return False and the lock not being acquired. Defaults to True.
        Note this value can be overridden by passing a ``blocking``
        argument to ``acquire``.

        ``blocking_timeout`` indicates the maximum amount of time in seconds to
        spend trying to acquire the lock. A value of ``None`` indicates
        continue trying forever. ``blocking_timeout`` can be specified as a
        float or integer, both representing the number of seconds to wait.

        ``thread_local`` indicates whether the lock token is placed in
        thread-local storage. By default, the token is placed in thread local
        storage so that a thread only sees its token, not a token set by
        another thread.
