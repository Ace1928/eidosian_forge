    Rewrite :class:`Piecewise` with mutually exclusive conditions.

    Explanation
    ===========

    SymPy represents the conditions of a :class:`Piecewise` in an
    "if-elif"-fashion, allowing more than one condition to be simultaneously
    True. The interpretation is that the first condition that is True is the
    case that holds. While this is a useful representation computationally it
    is not how a piecewise formula is typically shown in a mathematical text.
    The :func:`piecewise_exclusive` function can be used to rewrite any
    :class:`Piecewise` with more typical mutually exclusive conditions.

    Note that further manipulation of the resulting :class:`Piecewise`, e.g.
    simplifying it, will most likely make it non-exclusive. Hence, this is
    primarily a function to be used in conjunction with printing the Piecewise
    or if one would like to reorder the expression-condition pairs.

    If it is not possible to determine that all possibilities are covered by
    the different cases of the :class:`Piecewise` then a final
    :class:`~sympy.core.numbers.NaN` case will be included explicitly. This
    can be prevented by passing ``skip_nan=True``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import piecewise_exclusive, Symbol, Piecewise, S
    >>> x = Symbol('x', real=True)
    >>> p = Piecewise((0, x < 0), (S.Half, x <= 0), (1, True))
    >>> piecewise_exclusive(p)
    Piecewise((0, x < 0), (1/2, Eq(x, 0)), (1, x > 0))
    >>> piecewise_exclusive(Piecewise((2, x > 1)))
    Piecewise((2, x > 1), (nan, x <= 1))
    >>> piecewise_exclusive(Piecewise((2, x > 1)), skip_nan=True)
    Piecewise((2, x > 1))

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr: a SymPy expression.
        Any :class:`Piecewise` in the expression will be rewritten.
    skip_nan: ``bool`` (default ``False``)
        If ``skip_nan`` is set to ``True`` then a final
        :class:`~sympy.core.numbers.NaN` case will not be included.
    deep:  ``bool`` (default ``True``)
        If ``deep`` is ``True`` then :func:`piecewise_exclusive` will rewrite
        any :class:`Piecewise` subexpressions in ``expr`` rather than just
        rewriting ``expr`` itself.

    Returns
    =======

    An expression equivalent to ``expr`` but where all :class:`Piecewise` have
    been rewritten with mutually exclusive conditions.
