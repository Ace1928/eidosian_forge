def chain_matmul(*matrices, out=None):
    """Returns the matrix product of the :math:`N` 2-D tensors. This product is efficiently computed
    using the matrix chain order algorithm which selects the order in which incurs the lowest cost in terms
    of arithmetic operations (`[CLRS]`_). Note that since this is a function to compute the product, :math:`N`
    needs to be greater than or equal to 2; if equal to 2 then a trivial matrix-matrix product is returned.
    If :math:`N` is 1, then this is a no-op - the original matrix is returned as is.

    .. warning::

        :func:`torch.chain_matmul` is deprecated and will be removed in a future PyTorch release.
        Use :func:`torch.linalg.multi_dot` instead, which accepts a list of two or more tensors
        rather than multiple arguments.

    Args:
        matrices (Tensors...): a sequence of 2 or more 2-D tensors whose product is to be determined.
        out (Tensor, optional): the output tensor. Ignored if :attr:`out` = ``None``.

    Returns:
        Tensor: if the :math:`i^{th}` tensor was of dimensions :math:`p_{i} \\times p_{i + 1}`, then the product
        would be of dimensions :math:`p_{1} \\times p_{N + 1}`.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> a = torch.randn(3, 4)
        >>> b = torch.randn(4, 5)
        >>> c = torch.randn(5, 6)
        >>> d = torch.randn(6, 7)
        >>> # will raise a deprecation warning
        >>> torch.chain_matmul(a, b, c, d)
