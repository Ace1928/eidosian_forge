    Args:
        func (callable): A function that takes ``2 + len(rests)`` arguments, to be applied at the
            corresponding leaves of the pytrees with extra paths.
        tree (pytree): A pytree to be mapped over, with each leaf providing the second positional
            argument and the corresponding path providing the first positional argument to function
            ``func``.
        rests (tuple of pytree): A tuple of pytrees, each of which has the same structure as
            ``tree`` or has ``tree`` as a prefix.
        is_leaf (callable, optional): An optionally specified function that will be called at each
            flattening step. It should return a boolean, with :data:`True` stopping the traversal
            and the whole subtree being treated as a leaf, and :data:`False` indicating the
            flattening should traverse the current object.
        none_is_leaf (bool, optional): Whether to treat :data:`None` as a leaf. If :data:`False`,
            :data:`None` is a non-leaf node with arity 0. Thus :data:`None` is contained in the
            treespec rather than in the leaves list and :data:`None` will be remain in the result
            pytree. (default: :data:`False`)
        namespace (str, optional): The registry namespace used for custom pytree node types.
            (default: :const:`''`, i.e., the global namespace)

    Returns:
        A new pytree with the same structure as ``tree`` but with the value at each leaf given by
        ``func(p, x, *xs)`` where ``(p, x)`` are the path and value at the corresponding leaf in
        ``tree`` and ``xs`` is the tuple of values at corresponding nodes in ``rests``.
