def octahedral_graph(create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the Platonic Octahedral graph.

    The octahedral graph is the 6-node 12-edge Platonic graph having the
    connectivity of the octahedron [1]_. If 6 couples go to a party,
    and each person shakes hands with every person except his or her partner,
    then this graph describes the set of handshakes that take place;
    for this reason it is also called the cocktail party graph [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        Octahedral graph
