        For a given year, get the DST on and off transition times, expressed
        always on the standard time side. For zones with no transitions, this
        function returns ``None``.

        :param year:
            The year whose transitions you would like to query.

        :return:
            Returns a :class:`tuple` of :class:`datetime.datetime` objects,
            ``(dston, dstoff)`` for zones with an annual DST transition, or
            ``None`` for fixed offset zones.
