class ViTMAEModelOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Class for ViTMAEModel's outputs, with potential hidden states and attentions.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        mask (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Tensor indicating which patches are masked (1) and which are not (0).
        ids_restore (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`):
            Tensor containing the original index of the (shuffled) masked patches.
        hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`. Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer
            plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`. Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in
            the self-attention heads.
