    Given a registered model_uri (e.g. models:/<model_name>/<model_version>), this utility
    re-logs the model along with all the required model libraries back to the Model Registry.
    The required model libraries are stored along with the model as model artifacts. In
    addition, supporting files to the model (e.g. conda.yaml, requirements.txt) are modified
    to use the added libraries.

    By default, this utility creates a new model version under the same registered model specified
    by ``model_uri``. This behavior can be overridden by specifying the ``registered_model_name``
    argument.

    Args:
        model_uri: A registered model uri in the Model Registry of the form
            models:/<model_name>/<model_version/stage/latest>
        run_id: The ID of the run to which the model with libraries is logged. If None, the model
            with libraries is logged to the source run corresponding to model version
            specified by ``model_uri``; if the model version does not have a source run, a
            new run created.
        registered_model_name: The new model version (model with its libraries) is
            registered under the inputted registered_model_name. If None, a
            new version is logged to the existing model in the Model Registry.

    .. note::
        This utility only operates on a model that has been registered to the Model Registry.

    .. note::
        The libraries are only compatible with the platform on which they are added. Cross platform
        libraries are not supported.
