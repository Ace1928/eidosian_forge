        Creates a mask from the two sequences passed to be used in a sequence-pair classification task. An ALBERT
        sequence pair mask has the following format:

        ```
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
        | first sequence    | second sequence |
        ```

        if token_ids_1 is None, only returns the first portion of the mask (0s).

        Args:
            token_ids_0 (`List[int]`):
                List of ids.
            token_ids_1 (`List[int]`, *optional*):
                Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

        Returns:
            `List[int]`: List of [token type IDs](../glossary#token-type-ids) according to the given sequence(s).
