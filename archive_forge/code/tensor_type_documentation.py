    A binary relation denoted by <= that determines if t1 is more precise than t2.
    The relation is reflexive and transitive.
    returns True if t1 is more precise than t2 and False otherwise.
    Example:
        Dyn >= TensorType((1,2,3))
        int >= Dyn
        int >= int
        TensorType((1,Dyn,3)) <= TensorType((1,2,3))
