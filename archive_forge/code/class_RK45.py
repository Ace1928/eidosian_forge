    """Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4).

    This uses the Dormand-Prince pair of formulas [1]_. The error is controlled
    assuming accuracy of the fourth-order method accuracy, but steps are taken
    using the fifth-order accurate formula (local extrapolation is done).
    A quartic interpolation polynomial is used for the dense output [2]_.

    Can be applied in the complex domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Right-hand side of the system. The calling signature is ``fun(t, y)``.
        Here ``t`` is a scalar, and there are two options for the ndarray ``y``:
        It can either have shape (n,); then ``fun`` must return array_like with
        shape (n,). Alternatively it can have shape (n, k); then ``fun``
        must return an array_like with shape (n, k), i.e., each column
        corresponds to a single column in ``y``. The choice between the two
        options is determined by `vectorized` argument (see below).
    t0 : float
        Initial time.
    y0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial state.
    t_bound : float
        Boundary time - the integration won't continue beyond it. It also
        determines the direction of the integration.
    first_step : float or None, optional
        Initial step size. Default is ``None`` which means that the algorithm
        should choose.
    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is np.inf, i.e., the step size is not
        bounded and determined solely by the solver.
    rtol, atol : float and array_like, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerances. The solver keeps the local error
        estimates less than ``atol + rtol * abs(y)``. Here `rtol` controls a
        relative accuracy (number of correct digits), while `atol` controls
        absolute accuracy (number of correct decimal places). To achieve the
        desired `rtol`, set `atol` to be smaller than the smallest value that
        can be expected from ``rtol * abs(y)`` so that `rtol` dominates the
        allowable error. If `atol` is larger than ``rtol * abs(y)`` the
        number of correct digits is not guaranteed. Conversely, to achieve the
        desired `atol` set `rtol` such that ``rtol * abs(y)`` is always smaller
        than `atol`. If components of y have different scales, it might be
        beneficial to set different `atol` values for different components by
        passing array_like with shape (n,) for `atol`. Default values are
        1e-3 for `rtol` and 1e-6 for `atol`.
    vectorized : bool, optional
        Whether `fun` is implemented in a vectorized fashion. Default is False.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of equations.
    status : string
        Current status of the solver: 'running', 'finished' or 'failed'.
    t_bound : float
        Boundary time.
    direction : float
        Integration direction: +1 or -1.
    t : float
        Current time.
    y : ndarray
        Current state.
    t_old : float
        Previous time. None if no steps were made yet.
    step_size : float
        Size of the last successful step. None if no steps were made yet.
    nfev : int
        Number evaluations of the system's right-hand side.
    njev : int
        Number of evaluations of the Jacobian.
        Is always 0 for this solver as it does not use the Jacobian.
    nlu : int
        Number of LU decompositions. Is always 0 for this solver.
