Test all continuous distributions.

Parameters were chosen for those distributions that pass the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  This provides safe parameters for each
distributions so that we can perform further testing of class methods.

These tests currently check only/mostly for serious errors and exceptions,
not for numerically exact results.
