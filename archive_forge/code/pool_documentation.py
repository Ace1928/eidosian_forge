Puts all applicable (kw)args in self.items in object store

            Takes two registries - list for unhashable objects and dict
            for hashable objects. The registries are a part of a Pool object.
            The method iterates through all entries in items list (usually,
            there will be only one, but the number depends on joblib Parallel
            settings) and puts all of the args and kwargs into the object
            store, updating the registries.
            If an arg or kwarg is already in a registry, it will not be
            put again, and instead, the cached object ref will be used.
