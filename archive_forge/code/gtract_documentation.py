title: Tensor Estimation

    category: Diffusion.GTRACT

    description: This step will convert a b-value averaged diffusion tensor image to a 3x3 tensor voxel image. This step takes the diffusion tensor image data and generates a tensor representation of the data based on the signal intensity decay, b values applied, and the diffusion difrections. The apparent diffusion coefficient for a given orientation is computed on a pixel-by-pixel basis by fitting the image data (voxel intensities) to the Stejskal-Tanner equation. If at least 6 diffusion directions are used, then the diffusion tensor can be computed. This program uses itk::DiffusionTensor3DReconstructionImageFilter. The user can adjust background threshold, median filter, and isotropic resampling.
