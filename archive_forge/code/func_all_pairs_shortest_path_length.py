def all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G, cutoff=None):
    """Computes the shortest path lengths between all nodes in `G`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth at which to stop the search. Only paths of length at most
        `cutoff` are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    lengths : iterator
        (source, dictionary) iterator with dictionary keyed by target and
        shortest path length as the key value.

    Notes
    -----
    The iterator returned only has reachable node pairs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> length = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))
    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    ...     print(f"1 - {node}: {length[1][node]}")

    1 - 1: 0
    1 - 2: 1
    1 - 3: 2
    1 - 4: 3
    >>> length[3][2]
    1
    >>> length[2][2]
