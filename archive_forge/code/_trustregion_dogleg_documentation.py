        Minimize a function using the dog-leg trust-region algorithm.

        This algorithm requires function values and first and second derivatives.
        It also performs a costly Hessian decomposition for most iterations,
        and the Hessian is required to be positive definite.

        Parameters
        ----------
        trust_radius : float
            We are allowed to wander only this far away from the origin.

        Returns
        -------
        p : ndarray
            The proposed step.
        hits_boundary : bool
            True if the proposed step is on the boundary of the trust region.

        Notes
        -----
        The Hessian is required to be positive definite.
