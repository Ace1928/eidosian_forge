class TFSeq2SeqSequenceClassifierOutput(ModelOutput):
    """
    Base class for outputs of sequence-to-sequence sentence classification models.

    Args:
        loss (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(1,)`, *optional*, returned when `label` is provided):
            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) loss.
        logits (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, config.num_labels)`):
            Classification (or regression if config.num_labels==1) scores (before SoftMax).
        past_key_values (`List[tf.Tensor]`, *optional*, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`):
            List of `tf.Tensor` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tensor of shape `(2, batch_size, num_heads,
            sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`).

            Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) of the decoder that can be
            used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
        decoder_hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        decoder_attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            self-attention heads.
        cross_attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`
        encoder_last_hidden_state (`tf.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, *optional*):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder of the model.
        encoder_hidden_states (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the encoder at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        encoder_attentions (`tuple(tf.Tensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `tf.Tensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights of the encoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            self-attention heads.
