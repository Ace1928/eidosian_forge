class RepetitionPenaltyLogitsProcessor(LogitsProcessor):
    """
    [`LogitsProcessor`] that prevents the repetition of previous tokens through a penalty. This penalty is applied at
    most once per token. Note that, for decoder-only models like most LLMs, the considered tokens include the prompt.

    In the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf), the authors suggest the use of a penalty of around
    1.2 to achieve a good balance between truthful generation and lack of repetition. To penalize and reduce
    repetition, use `penalty` values above 1.0, where a higher value penalizes more strongly. To reward and encourage
    repetition, use `penalty` values between 0.0 and 1.0, where a lower value rewards more strongly.

    Args:
        penalty (`float`):
            The parameter for repetition penalty. 1.0 means no penalty. Above 1.0 penalizes previously generated
            tokens. Between 0.0 and 1.0 rewards previously generated tokens.

    Examples:

    ```py
    >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

    >>> # Initializing the model and tokenizer for it
    >>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilgpt2")
    >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert/distilgpt2")
    >>> inputs = tokenizer(["I'm not going to"], return_tensors="pt")

    >>> # This shows a normal generate without any specific parameters
    >>> summary_ids = model.generate(**inputs)
    >>> print(tokenizer.batch_decode(summary_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])
    I'm not going to be able to do that. I'm going to be able to do that

    >>> # This generates a penalty for repeated tokens
    >>> penalized_ids = model.generate(**inputs, repetition_penalty=1.1)
    >>> print(tokenizer.batch_decode(penalized_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])
    I'm not going to be able to do that. I'll just have to go out and play
