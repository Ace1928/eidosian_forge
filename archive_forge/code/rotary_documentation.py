    The rotary position embeddings from RoFormer_ (Su et. al).
    A crucial insight from the method is that the query and keys are
    transformed by rotation matrices which depend on the relative positions.

    Other implementations are available in the Rotary Transformer repo_ and in
    GPT-NeoX_, GPT-NeoX was an inspiration

    .. warning: Please note that this embedding is not registered on purpose, as it is transformative
        (it does not create the embedding dimension) and will likely be picked up (imported) on a ad-hoc basis
