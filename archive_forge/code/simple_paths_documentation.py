Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths using bidirectional search.

    This function returns the shortest path between source and target
    ignoring nodes and edges in the containers ignore_nodes and
    ignore_edges.

    This is a custom modification of the standard Dijkstra bidirectional
    shortest path implementation at networkx.algorithms.weighted

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node.

    target : node
       Ending node.

    weight: string, function, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key or weight function corresponding to the edge weight

    ignore_nodes : container of nodes
       nodes to ignore, optional

    ignore_edges : container of edges
       edges to ignore, optional

    Returns
    -------
    length : number
        Shortest path length.

    Returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
    The first dictionary stores distance from the source.
    The second stores the path from the source to that node.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is pi*r*r while the
    others are 2*pi*r/2*r/2, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).
