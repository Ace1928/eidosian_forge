def boundary_conditions(self):
    """
        Returns a dictionary of boundary conditions applied on the beam.
        The dictionary has two keywords namely slope and deflection.
        The value of each keyword is a list of tuple, where each tuple
        contains location and value of a boundary condition in the format
        (location, value). Further each value is a list corresponding to
        slope or deflection(s) values along three axes at that location.

        Examples
        ========
        There is a beam of length 4 meters. The slope at 0 should be 4 along
        the x-axis and 0 along others. At the other end of beam, deflection
        along all the three axes should be zero.

        >>> from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam3D
        >>> from sympy import symbols
        >>> l, E, G, I, A, x = symbols('l, E, G, I, A, x')
        >>> b = Beam3D(30, E, G, I, A, x)
        >>> b.bc_slope = [(0, (4, 0, 0))]
        >>> b.bc_deflection = [(4, [0, 0, 0])]
        >>> b.boundary_conditions
        {'deflection': [(4, [0, 0, 0])], 'slope': [(0, (4, 0, 0))]}

        Here the deflection of the beam should be ``0`` along all the three axes at ``4``.
        Similarly, the slope of the beam should be ``4`` along x-axis and ``0``
        along y and z axis at ``0``.
