    """Return permutations of [0, 1, ..., n - 1] such that each permutation
    differs from the last by the exchange of a single pair of neighbors.
    The ``n!`` permutations are returned as an iterator. In order to obtain
    the next permutation from a random starting permutation, use the
    ``next_trotterjohnson`` method of the Permutation class (which generates
    the same sequence in a different manner).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from itertools import permutations
    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import generate_bell
    >>> from sympy import zeros, Matrix

    This is the sort of permutation used in the ringing of physical bells,
    and does not produce permutations in lexicographical order. Rather, the
    permutations differ from each other by exactly one inversion, and the
    position at which the swapping occurs varies periodically in a simple
    fashion. Consider the first few permutations of 4 elements generated
    by ``permutations`` and ``generate_bell``:

    >>> list(permutations(range(4)))[:5]
    [(0, 1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 3, 2), (0, 2, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3, 1), (0, 3, 1, 2)]
    >>> list(generate_bell(4))[:5]
    [(0, 1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 3, 2), (0, 3, 1, 2), (3, 0, 1, 2), (3, 0, 2, 1)]

    Notice how the 2nd and 3rd lexicographical permutations have 3 elements
    out of place whereas each "bell" permutation always has only two
    elements out of place relative to the previous permutation (and so the
    signature (+/-1) of a permutation is opposite of the signature of the
    previous permutation).

    How the position of inversion varies across the elements can be seen
    by tracing out where the largest number appears in the permutations:

    >>> m = zeros(4, 24)
    >>> for i, p in enumerate(generate_bell(4)):
    ...     m[:, i] = Matrix([j - 3 for j in list(p)])  # make largest zero
    >>> m.print_nonzero('X')
    [XXX  XXXXXX  XXXXXX  XXX]
    [XX XX XXXX XX XXXX XX XX]
    [X XXXX XX XXXX XX XXXX X]
    [ XXXXXX  XXXXXX  XXXXXX ]
