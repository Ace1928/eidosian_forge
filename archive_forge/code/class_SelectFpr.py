    """Filter: Select the pvalues below alpha based on a FPR test.

    FPR test stands for False Positive Rate test. It controls the total
    amount of false detections.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <univariate_feature_selection>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score_func : callable, default=f_classif
        Function taking two arrays X and y, and returning a pair of arrays
        (scores, pvalues).
        Default is f_classif (see below "See Also"). The default function only
        works with classification tasks.

    alpha : float, default=5e-2
        Features with p-values less than `alpha` are selected.

    Attributes
    ----------
    scores_ : array-like of shape (n_features,)
        Scores of features.

    pvalues_ : array-like of shape (n_features,)
        p-values of feature scores.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

        .. versionadded:: 0.24

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

        .. versionadded:: 1.0
