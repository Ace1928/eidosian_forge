def binary_average_precision(preds: Tensor, target: Tensor, thresholds: Optional[Union[int, List[float], Tensor]]=None, ignore_index: Optional[int]=None, validate_args: bool=True) -> Tensor:
    """Compute the average precision (AP) score for binary tasks.

    The AP score summarizes a precision-recall curve as an weighted mean of precisions at each threshold, with the
    difference in recall from the previous threshold as weight:

    .. math::
        AP = \\sum{n} (R_n - R_{n-1}) P_n

    where :math:`P_n, R_n` is the respective precision and recall at threshold index :math:`n`. This value is
    equivalent to the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).

    Accepts the following input tensors:

    - ``preds`` (float tensor): ``(N, ...)``. Preds should be a tensor containing probabilities or logits for each
      observation. If preds has values outside [0,1] range we consider the input to be logits and will auto apply
      sigmoid per element.
    - ``target`` (int tensor): ``(N, ...)``. Target should be a tensor containing ground truth labels, and therefore
      only contain {0,1} values (except if `ignore_index` is specified). The value 1 always encodes the positive class.

    Additional dimension ``...`` will be flattened into the batch dimension.

    The implementation both supports calculating the metric in a non-binned but accurate version and a binned version
    that is less accurate but more memory efficient. Setting the `thresholds` argument to `None` will activate the
    non-binned  version that uses memory of size :math:`\\mathcal{O}(n_{samples})` whereas setting the `thresholds`
    argument to either an integer, list or a 1d tensor will use a binned version that uses memory of
    size :math:`\\mathcal{O}(n_{thresholds})` (constant memory).

    Args:
        preds: Tensor with predictions
        target: Tensor with true labels
        thresholds:
            Can be one of:

            - If set to `None`, will use a non-binned approach where thresholds are dynamically calculated from
              all the data. Most accurate but also most memory consuming approach.
            - If set to an `int` (larger than 1), will use that number of thresholds linearly spaced from
              0 to 1 as bins for the calculation.
            - If set to an `list` of floats, will use the indicated thresholds in the list as bins for the calculation
            - If set to an 1d `tensor` of floats, will use the indicated thresholds in the tensor as
              bins for the calculation.

        ignore_index:
            Specifies a target value that is ignored and does not contribute to the metric calculation
        validate_args: bool indicating if input arguments and tensors should be validated for correctness.
            Set to ``False`` for faster computations.

    Returns:
        A single scalar with the average precision score

    Example:
        >>> from torchmetrics.functional.classification import binary_average_precision
        >>> preds = torch.tensor([0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8])
        >>> target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 1, 0])
        >>> binary_average_precision(preds, target, thresholds=None)
        tensor(0.5833)
        >>> binary_average_precision(preds, target, thresholds=5)
        tensor(0.6667)
