def assert_shallow_structure(shallow_tree, input_tree, check_types=True):
    """Asserts that `shallow_tree` is a shallow structure of `input_tree`.

  That is, this function tests if the `input_tree` structure can be created from
  the `shallow_tree` structure by replacing its leaf nodes with deeper
  tree structures.

  Examples:

  The following code will raise an exception:
  ```python
    shallow_tree = ["a", "b"]
    input_tree = ["c", ["d", "e"], "f"]
    assert_shallow_structure(shallow_tree, input_tree)
  ```

  The following code will not raise an exception:
  ```python
    shallow_tree = ["a", "b"]
    input_tree = ["c", ["d", "e"]]
    assert_shallow_structure(shallow_tree, input_tree)
  ```

  Args:
    shallow_tree: an arbitrarily nested structure.
    input_tree: an arbitrarily nested structure.
    check_types: if `True` (default) the sequence types of `shallow_tree` and
      `input_tree` have to be the same.

  Raises:
    TypeError: If `shallow_tree` is a sequence but `input_tree` is not.
    TypeError: If the sequence types of `shallow_tree` are different from
      `input_tree`. Only raised if `check_types` is `True`.
    ValueError: If the sequence lengths of `shallow_tree` are different from
      `input_tree`.
