    .. note::
        This function is often used in conjunction with :func:`grid_sample`
        to build `Spatial Transformer Networks`_ .

    Args:
        theta (Tensor): input batch of affine matrices with shape
            (:math:`N \\times 2 \\times 3`) for 2D or
            (:math:`N \\times 3 \\times 4`) for 3D
        size (torch.Size): the target output image size.
            (:math:`N \\times C \\times H \\times W` for 2D or
            :math:`N \\times C \\times D \\times H \\times W` for 3D)
            Example: torch.Size((32, 3, 24, 24))
        align_corners (bool, optional): if ``True``, consider ``-1`` and ``1``
            to refer to the centers of the corner pixels rather than the image corners.
            Refer to :func:`grid_sample` for a more complete description.
            A grid generated by :func:`affine_grid` should be passed to :func:`grid_sample`
            with the same setting for this option.
            Default: ``False``

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): output Tensor of size (:math:`N \\times H \\times W \\times 2`)

    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, the grid positions depend on the pixel
        size relative to the input image size, and so the locations sampled by
        :func:`grid_sample` will differ for the same input given at different
        resolutions (that is, after being upsampled or downsampled).
        The default behavior up to version 1.2.0 was ``align_corners = True``.
        Since then, the default behavior has been changed to ``align_corners = False``,
        in order to bring it in line with the default for :func:`interpolate`.
    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, 2D affine transforms on 1D data and
        3D affine transforms on 2D data (that is, when one of the spatial
        dimensions has unit size) are ill-defined, and not an intended use case.
        This is not a problem when ``align_corners = False``.
        Up to version 1.2.0, all grid points along a unit dimension were
        considered arbitrarily to be at ``-1``.
        From version 1.3.0, under ``align_corners = True`` all grid points
        along a unit dimension are considered to be at ``0``
        (the center of the input image).
