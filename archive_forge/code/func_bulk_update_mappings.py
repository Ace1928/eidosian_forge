            This method is a legacy feature as of the 2.0 series of
            SQLAlchemy.   For modern bulk INSERT and UPDATE, see
            the sections :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_insert` and
            :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_update`.  The 2.0 API shares
            implementation details with this method and adds new features
            as well.

        :param mapper: a mapped class, or the actual :class:`_orm.Mapper`
         object,
         representing the single kind of object represented within the mapping
         list.

        :param mappings: a sequence of dictionaries, each one containing the
         state of the mapped row to be updated, in terms of the attribute names
         on the mapped class.   If the mapping refers to multiple tables, such
         as a joined-inheritance mapping, each dictionary may contain keys
         corresponding to all tables.   All those keys which are present and
         are not part of the primary key are applied to the SET clause of the
         UPDATE statement; the primary key values, which are required, are
         applied to the WHERE clause.
