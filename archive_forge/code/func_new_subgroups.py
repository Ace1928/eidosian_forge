    Create subgroups of equal size.

    By default, it creates intra-machine subgroups,
    where each of which contains all the ranks of a machine, based on the assumption
    that each machine has the same number of devices.

    This is a convenience API that calls ``new_group`` to generate multiple subgroups.
    It requires that all processes in the main group (i.e. all
    processes that are part of the distributed job) enter this function, even
    if they are not going to be members of the group.

    .. warning::
        If ``group_size`` is passed in, the world size must be divisible by ``group_size``.
        If no ``group_size`` is passed in, it believe that you are creating a group based
        on CUDA and determining the group size by number of CUDA devices, and if not all
        the machines have the same number of devices, the subgroup division will be
        different across nodes and can cause unexpected behaviors. Therefore, if you are
        creating a subgroup that does not depend on CUDA (such as Gloo on CPU), please
        pass in ``group_size`` correctly.

    .. warning::
        Using multiple process groups with the ``NCCL`` backend concurrently
        is not safe and the user should perform explicit synchronization in
        their application to ensure only one process group is used at a time.
        This means collectives from one process group should have completed
        execution on the device (not just enqueued since CUDA execution is
        async) before collectives from another process group are enqueued.
        See `Using multiple NCCL communicators concurrently <https://docs.nvid
        ia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/usage/communicators.html#using
        -multiple-nccl-communicators-concurrently>`_ for more details.

    Args:
        group_size (int, optional): The size of each subgroup. If ``None``,
            the default subgroup size is equal to the number of devices on each machine,
            based on the assumption that each machine has exactly the same
            number of devices. Default is ``None``.
        timeout (timedelta, optional): see `init_process_group` for details and default value.
        backend (str or Backend, optional): The backend to use. Depending on
            build-time configurations, valid values are ``gloo`` and ``nccl``.
            By default uses the same backend as the global group. This field
            should be given as a lowercase string (e.g., ``"gloo"``), which can
            also be accessed via :class:`Backend` attributes (e.g.,
            ``Backend.GLOO``). If ``None`` is passed in, the backend
            corresponding to the default process group will be used. Default is
            ``None``.
        pg_options (ProcessGroupOptions, optional): process group options
            specifying what additional options need to be passed in during
            the construction of specific process groups. i.e. for the ``nccl``
            backend, ``is_high_priority_stream`` can be specified so that
            process group can pick up high priority cuda streams.

    Returns:
        The subgroup containing the current rank, and all the subgroups used for cleanup.

    Examples:
        >>> # Create intra-machine subgroups.
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("need process group init")
        >>> cur_subgroup, subgroups = dist.new_subgroups()
        >>> # Allreduce within the machine.
        >>> rank = dist.get_rank()
        >>> tensor = torch.ones(1, device=rank) * rank
        >>> dist.all_reduce(tensor, group=cur_subgroup)
        >>> tensor
        tensor([8])     # Assume 8 is the number of CUDA devices per machine.
        >>> # Cleanup.
        >>> for subgroup in subgroups:
        >>>     dist.destroy_process_group(subgroup)
