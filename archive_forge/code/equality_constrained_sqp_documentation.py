Solve nonlinear equality-constrained problem using trust-region SQP.

    Solve optimization problem:

        minimize fun(x)
        subject to: constr(x) = 0

    using Byrd-Omojokun Trust-Region SQP method described in [1]_. Several
    implementation details are based on [2]_ and [3]_, p. 549.
