  Messages:
    DimensionsValue:  If this map is nonempty, then this policy applies only
      to specific values for dimensions defined in the limit unit. For
      example, an policy on a limit with the unit 1/{project}/{region} could
      contain an entry with the key "region" and the value "us-east-1"; the
      policy is only applied to quota consumed in that region. This map has
      the following restrictions: * If "region" appears as a key, its value
      must be a valid Cloud region. * If "zone" appears as a key, its value
      must be a valid Cloud zone. * Keys other than "region" or "zone" are not
      valid.

  Fields:
    container: The cloud resource container at which the quota policy is
      created. The format is {container_type}/{container_number}
    dimensions:  If this map is nonempty, then this policy applies only to
      specific values for dimensions defined in the limit unit. For example,

    metric: The name of the metric to which this policy applies. An example
      name would be: `compute.googleapis.com/cpus`
    name: The resource name of the policy. This name is generated by the
      server when the policy is created. Example names would be: `organization
      s/123/services/compute.googleapis.com/consumerQuotaMetrics/compute.googl
      eapis.com%2Fcpus/limits/%2Fproject%2Fregion/adminQuotaPolicies/4a3f2c1d`
    policyValue: The quota policy value. Can be any nonnegative integer, or -1
      (unlimited quota).
    unit: The limit unit of the limit to which this policy applies. An example
      unit would be: `1/{project}/{region}` Note that `{project}` and
      `{region}` are not placeholders in this example; the literal characters
      `{` and `}` occur in the string.
