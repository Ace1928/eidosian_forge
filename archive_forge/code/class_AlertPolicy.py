class AlertPolicy(_messages.Message):
    """A description of the conditions under which some aspect of your system
  is considered to be "unhealthy" and the ways to notify people or services
  about this state. For an overview of alert policies, see Introduction to
  Alerting (https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/).

  Enums:
    CombinerValueValuesEnum: How to combine the results of multiple conditions
      to determine if an incident should be opened. If
      condition_time_series_query_language is present, this must be
      COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED.
    SeverityValueValuesEnum: Optional. The severity of an alert policy
      indicates how important incidents generated by that policy are. The
      severity level will be displayed on the Incident detail page and in
      notifications.

  Messages:
    UserLabelsValue: User-supplied key/value data to be used for organizing
      and identifying the AlertPolicy objects.The field can contain up to 64
      entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128
      bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only
      lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin
      with a letter.Note that Prometheus {alert name} is a valid Prometheus
      label names (https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-
      names-and-labels), whereas Prometheus {rule group} is an unrestricted
      UTF-8 string. This means that they cannot be stored as-is in user
      labels, because they may contain characters that are not allowed in
      user-label values.

  Fields:
    alertStrategy: Control over how this alert policy's notification channels
      are notified.
    combiner: How to combine the results of multiple conditions to determine
      if an incident should be opened. If condition_time_series_query_language
      is present, this must be COMBINE_UNSPECIFIED.
    conditions: A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are
      combined by AND or OR according to the combiner field. If the combined
      conditions evaluate to true, then an incident is created. A policy can
      have from one to six conditions. If condition_time_series_query_language
      is present, it must be the only condition. If
      condition_monitoring_query_language is present, it must be the only
      condition.
    creationRecord: A read-only record of the creation of the alerting policy.
      If provided in a call to create or update, this field will be ignored.
    displayName: A short name or phrase used to identify the policy in
      dashboards, notifications, and incidents. To avoid confusion, don't use
      the same display name for multiple policies in the same project. The
      name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.The convention for the
      display_name of a PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition is "{rule group
      name}/{alert name}", where the {rule group name} and {alert name} should
      be taken from the corresponding Prometheus configuration file. This
      convention is not enforced. In any case the display_name is not a unique
      key of the AlertPolicy.
    documentation: Documentation that is included with notifications and
      incidents related to this policy. Best practice is for the documentation
      to include information to help responders understand, mitigate,
      escalate, and correct the underlying problems detected by the alerting
      policy. Notification channels that have limited capacity might not show
      this documentation.
    enabled: Whether or not the policy is enabled. On write, the default
      interpretation if unset is that the policy is enabled. On read, clients
      should not make any assumption about the state if it has not been
      populated. The field should always be populated on List and Get
      operations, unless a field projection has been specified that strips it
      out.
    mutationRecord: A read-only record of the most recent change to the
      alerting policy. If provided in a call to create or update, this field
      will be ignored.
    name: Required if the policy exists. The resource name for this policy.
      The format is:
      projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[ALERT_POLICY_ID]
      [ALERT_POLICY_ID] is assigned by Cloud Monitoring when the policy is
      created. When calling the alertPolicies.create method, do not include
      the name field in the alerting policy passed as part of the request.
    notificationChannels: Identifies the notification channels to which
      notifications should be sent when incidents are opened or closed or when
      new violations occur on an already opened incident. Each element of this
      array corresponds to the name field in each of the NotificationChannel
      objects that are returned from the ListNotificationChannels method. The
      format of the entries in this field is:
      projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/notificationChannels/[CHANNEL_ID]
    severity: Optional. The severity of an alert policy indicates how
      important incidents generated by that policy are. The severity level
      will be displayed on the Incident detail page and in notifications.
    userLabels: User-supplied key/value data to be used for organizing and
      identifying the AlertPolicy objects.The field can contain up to 64
      entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters or 128
      bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only
      lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin
      with a letter.Note that Prometheus {alert name} is a valid Prometheus
      label names (https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-
      names-and-labels), whereas Prometheus {rule group} is an unrestricted
      UTF-8 string. This means that they cannot be stored as-is in user
      labels, because they may contain characters that are not allowed in
      user-label values.
    validity: Read-only description of how the alert policy is invalid. This
      field is only set when the alert policy is invalid. An invalid alert
      policy will not generate incidents.
