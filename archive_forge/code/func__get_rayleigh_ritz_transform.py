    """Return a transformation matrix that is used in Rayleigh-Ritz
        procedure for reducing a general eigenvalue problem :math:`(S^TAS)
        C = (S^TBS) C E` to a standard eigenvalue problem :math: `(Ri^T
        S^TAS Ri) Z = Z E` where `C = Ri Z`.

        .. note:: In the original Rayleight-Ritz procedure in
          [DuerschEtal2018], the problem is formulated as follows::

            SAS = S^T A S
            SBS = S^T B S
            D = (<diagonal matrix of SBS>) ** -1/2
            R^T R = Cholesky(D SBS D)
            Ri = D R^-1
            solve symeig problem Ri^T SAS Ri Z = Theta Z
            C = Ri Z

          To reduce the number of matrix products (denoted by empty
          space between matrices), here we introduce element-wise
          products (denoted by symbol `*`) so that the Rayleight-Ritz
          procedure becomes::

            SAS = S^T A S
            SBS = S^T B S
            d = (<diagonal of SBS>) ** -1/2    # this is 1-d column vector
            dd = d d^T                         # this is 2-d matrix
            R^T R = Cholesky(dd * SBS)
            Ri = R^-1 * d                      # broadcasting
            solve symeig problem Ri^T SAS Ri Z = Theta Z
            C = Ri Z

          where `dd` is 2-d matrix that replaces matrix products `D M
          D` with one element-wise product `M * dd`; and `d` replaces
          matrix product `D M` with element-wise product `M *
          d`. Also, creating the diagonal matrix `D` is avoided.

        Args:
        S (Tensor): the matrix basis for the search subspace, size is
                    :math:`(m, n)`.

        Returns:
        Ri (tensor): upper-triangular transformation matrix of size
                     :math:`(n, n)`.
