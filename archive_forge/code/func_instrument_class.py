def instrument_class(self, mapper: Mapper[Any]) -> None:
    """Hook called by the Mapper to the property to initiate
        instrumentation of the class attribute managed by this
        MapperProperty.

        The MapperProperty here will typically call out to the
        attributes module to set up an InstrumentedAttribute.

        This step is the first of two steps to set up an InstrumentedAttribute,
        and is called early in the mapper setup process.

        The second step is typically the init_class_attribute step,
        called from StrategizedProperty via the post_instrument_class()
        hook.  This step assigns additional state to the InstrumentedAttribute
        (specifically the "impl") which has been determined after the
        MapperProperty has determined what kind of persistence
        management it needs to do (e.g. scalar, object, collection, etc).
