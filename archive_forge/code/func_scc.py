        Explanation
        ===========

        A square matrix can be considered as the adjacency matrix for a
        directed graph where the row and column indices are the vertices. In
        this graph if there is an edge from vertex ``i`` to vertex ``j`` if
        ``M[i, j]`` is nonzero. This routine computes the strongly connected
        components of that graph which are subsets of the rows and columns that
        are connected by some nonzero element of the matrix. The strongly
        connected components are useful because many operations such as the
        determinant can be computed by working with the submatrices
        corresponding to each component.

        Examples
        ========

        Find the strongly connected components of a matrix:

        >>> from sympy import ZZ
        >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DomainMatrix
        >>> M = DomainMatrix([[ZZ(1), ZZ(0), ZZ(2)],
        ...                   [ZZ(0), ZZ(3), ZZ(0)],
        ...                   [ZZ(4), ZZ(6), ZZ(5)]], (3, 3), ZZ)
        >>> M.scc()
        [[1], [0, 2]]

        Compute the determinant from the components:

        >>> MM = M.to_Matrix()
        >>> MM
        Matrix([
        [1, 0, 2],
        [0, 3, 0],
        [4, 6, 5]])
        >>> MM[[1], [1]]
        Matrix([[3]])
        >>> MM[[0, 2], [0, 2]]
        Matrix([
        [1, 2],
        [4, 5]])
        >>> MM.det()
        -9
        >>> MM[[1], [1]].det() * MM[[0, 2], [0, 2]].det()
        -9

        The components are given in reverse topological order and represent a
        permutation of the rows and columns that will bring the matrix into
        block lower-triangular form:

        >>> MM[[1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2]]
        Matrix([
        [3, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 2],
        [6, 4, 5]])

        Returns
        =======

        List of lists of integers
            Each list represents a strongly connected component.
