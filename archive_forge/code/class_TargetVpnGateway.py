    """Represents a Target VPN Gateway resource. The target VPN gateway
  resource represents a Classic Cloud VPN gateway. For more information, read
  the the Cloud VPN Overview.

  Enums:
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the VPN gateway, which
      can be one of the following: CREATING, READY, FAILED, or DELETING.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    forwardingRules: [Output Only] A list of URLs to the ForwardingRule
      resources. ForwardingRules are created using
      compute.forwardingRules.insert and associated with a VPN gateway.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetVpnGateway for
      target VPN gateways.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      TargetVpnGateway, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a TargetVpnGateway.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: URL of the network to which this VPN gateway is attached.
      Provided by the client when the VPN gateway is created.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the target VPN gateway
      resides. You must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It
      is not settable as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the VPN gateway, which can be one of
      the following: CREATING, READY, FAILED, or DELETING.
    tunnels: [Output Only] A list of URLs to VpnTunnel resources. VpnTunnels
      are created using the compute.vpntunnels.insert method and associated
      with a VPN gateway.
