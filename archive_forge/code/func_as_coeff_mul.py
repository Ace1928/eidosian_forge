    """Return the tuple (c, args) where self is written as a Mul, ``m``.

        c should be a Rational multiplied by any factors of the Mul that are
        independent of deps.

        args should be a tuple of all other factors of m; args is empty
        if self is a Number or if self is independent of deps (when given).

        This should be used when you do not know if self is a Mul or not but
        you want to treat self as a Mul or if you want to process the
        individual arguments of the tail of self as a Mul.

        - if you know self is a Mul and want only the head, use self.args[0];
        - if you do not want to process the arguments of the tail but need the
          tail then use self.as_two_terms() which gives the head and tail;
        - if you want to split self into an independent and dependent parts
          use ``self.as_independent(*deps)``
