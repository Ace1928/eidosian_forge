Construct a multi-dimensional "meshgrid".

    ``grid = nd_grid()`` creates an instance which will return a mesh-grid
    when indexed.  The dimension and number of the output arrays are equal
    to the number of indexing dimensions.  If the step length is not a
    complex number, then the stop is not inclusive.

    However, if the step length is a **complex number** (e.g. 5j), then the
    integer part of its magnitude is interpreted as specifying the
    number of points to create between the start and stop values, where
    the stop value **is inclusive**.

    If instantiated with an argument of ``sparse=True``, the mesh-grid is
    open (or not fleshed out) so that only one-dimension of each returned
    argument is greater than 1.

    Args:
        sparse (bool, optional): Whether the grid is sparse or not.
            Default is False.
