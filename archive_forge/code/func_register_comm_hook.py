    """Register a communication hook.

        This is an enhancement that provides a flexible hook to users where they can specify how FSDP aggregates
        gradients across multiple workers.
        This hook can be used to implement several algorithms like
        `GossipGrad <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05880>`_ and gradient compression
        which involve different communication strategies for
        parameter syncs while training with :class:`FullyShardedDataParallel`.

        .. warning ::
            FSDP communication hook should be registered before running an initial forward pass
            and only once.

        Args:
            state (object): Passed to the hook to maintain any state information during the training process.
                            Examples include error feedback in gradient compression,
                            peers to communicate with next in `GossipGrad <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05880>`_, etc.
                            It is locally stored by each worker
                            and shared by all the gradient tensors on the worker.
            hook (Callable): Callable, which has one of the following signatures:
                            1) ``hook: Callable[torch.Tensor] -> None``:
                            This function takes in a Python tensor, which represents
                            the full, flattened, unsharded gradient with respect to all variables
                            corresponding to the model this FSDP unit is wrapping
                            (that are not wrapped by other FSDP sub-units).
                            It then performs all necessary processing and returns ``None``;
                            2) ``hook: Callable[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor] -> None``:
                            This function takes in two Python tensors, the first one represents
                            the full, flattened, unsharded gradient with respect to all variables
                            corresponding to the model this FSDP unit is wrapping
                            (that are not wrapped by other FSDP sub-units). The latter
                            represents a pre-sized tensor to store a chunk of a sharded gradient after
                            reduction.
                            In both cases, callable performs all necessary processing and returns ``None``.
                            Callables with signature 1 are expected to handle gradient communication for a `NO_SHARD` case.
                            Callables with signature 2 are expected to handle gradient communication for sharded cases.
