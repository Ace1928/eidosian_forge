    """Given an iterable of file names in a source distribution, return the "names" that should
    be marked for assertion rewrite.

    For example the package "pytest_mock/__init__.py" should be added as "pytest_mock" in
    the assertion rewrite mechanism.

    This function has to deal with dist-info based distributions and egg based distributions
    (which are still very much in use for "editable" installs).

    Here are the file names as seen in a dist-info based distribution:

        pytest_mock/__init__.py
        pytest_mock/_version.py
        pytest_mock/plugin.py
        pytest_mock.egg-info/PKG-INFO

    Here are the file names as seen in an egg based distribution:

        src/pytest_mock/__init__.py
        src/pytest_mock/_version.py
        src/pytest_mock/plugin.py
        src/pytest_mock.egg-info/PKG-INFO
        LICENSE
        setup.py

    We have to take in account those two distribution flavors in order to determine which
    names should be considered for assertion rewriting.
