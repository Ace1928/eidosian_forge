        Parameters
        ----------
        effect_size : float
            standardized effect size, difference between the two means divided
            by the standard deviation. effect size has to be positive.
        nobs1 : int or float
            number of observations of sample 1. The number of observations of
            sample two is ratio times the size of sample 1,
            i.e. ``nobs2 = nobs1 * ratio``
            ``ratio`` can be set to zero in order to get the power for a
            one sample test.
        alpha : float in interval (0,1)
            significance level, e.g. 0.05, is the probability of a type I
            error, that is wrong rejections if the Null Hypothesis is true.
        ratio : float
            ratio of the number of observations in sample 2 relative to
            sample 1. see description of nobs1
        alternative : str, 'two-sided' (default), 'larger', 'smaller'
            extra argument to choose whether the power is calculated for a
            two-sided (default) or one sided test. The one-sided test can be
            either 'larger', 'smaller'.

        Returns
        -------
        power : float
            Power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.

        nobs1 : int or float

            sample two is ratio times the size of sample 1,
            i.e. ``nobs2 = nobs1 * ratio``

        power : float in interval (0,1)
            power of the test, e.g. 0.8, is one minus the probability of a
            type II error. Power is the probability that the test correctly
            rejects the Null Hypothesis if the Alternative Hypothesis is true.
        ratio : float
            ratio of the number of observations in sample 2 relative to
            sample 1. see description of nobs1
            The default for ratio is 1; to solve for ration given the other
            arguments it has to be explicitly set to None.
        alternative : str, 'two-sided' (default), 'larger', 'smaller'
            extra argument to choose whether the power is calculated for a
            two-sided (default) or one sided test. The one-sided test can be
            either 'larger', 'smaller'.

        Returns
        -------
        value : float
            The value of the parameter that was set to None in the call. The
            value solves the power equation given the remaining parameters.


        Notes
        -----
        The function uses scipy.optimize for finding the value that satisfies
        the power equation. It first uses ``brentq`` with a prior search for
        bounds. If this fails to find a root, ``fsolve`` is used. If ``fsolve``
        also fails, then, for ``alpha``, ``power`` and ``effect_size``,
        ``brentq`` with fixed bounds is used. However, there can still be cases
        where this fails.
