This function helps interpolate positional embeddings during checkpoint loading,
    especially when you want to apply a pre-trained model on images with different resolution.

    Args:
        image_size (int): Image size of the new model.
        patch_size (int): Patch size of the new model.
        model_state (OrderedDict[str, torch.Tensor]): State dict of the pre-trained model.
        interpolation_mode (str): The algorithm used for upsampling. Default: bicubic.
        reset_heads (bool): If true, not copying the state of heads. Default: False.

    Returns:
        OrderedDict[str, torch.Tensor]: A state dict which can be loaded into the new model.
