Converts an RLlib MultiAgentEnv into a BaseEnv object.

        The resulting BaseEnv is always vectorized (contains n
        sub-environments) to support batched forward passes, where n may
        also be 1. BaseEnv also supports async execution via the `poll` and
        `send_actions` methods and thus supports external simulators.

        Args:
            make_env: A callable taking an int as input (which indicates
                the number of individual sub-environments within the final
                vectorized BaseEnv) and returning one individual
                sub-environment.
            num_envs: The number of sub-environments to create in the
                resulting (vectorized) BaseEnv. The already existing `env`
                will be one of the `num_envs`.
            remote_envs: Whether each sub-env should be a @ray.remote
                actor. You can set this behavior in your config via the
                `remote_worker_envs=True` option.
            remote_env_batch_wait_ms: The wait time (in ms) to poll remote
                sub-environments for, if applicable. Only used if
                `remote_envs` is True.

        Returns:
            The resulting BaseEnv object.
