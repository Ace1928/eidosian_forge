  Enums:
    CvssVersionValueValuesEnum: Output only. CVSS version used to populate
      cvss_score and severity.
    EffectiveSeverityValueValuesEnum: The distro assigned severity for this
      vulnerability when it is available, and note provider assigned severity
      when distro has not yet assigned a severity for this vulnerability. When
      there are multiple PackageIssues for this vulnerability, they can have
      different effective severities because some might be provided by the
      distro while others are provided by the language ecosystem for a
      language pack. For this reason, it is advised to use the effective
      severity on the PackageIssue level. In the case where multiple
      PackageIssues have differing effective severities, this field should be
      the highest severity for any of the PackageIssues.
    SeverityValueValuesEnum: Output only. The note provider assigned Severity
      of the vulnerability.

  Fields:
    cvssScore: Output only. The CVSS score of this vulnerability. CVSS score
      is on a scale of 0-10 where 0 indicates low severity and 10 indicates
      high severity.
    cvssV2: The cvss v2 score for the vulnerability.
    cvssV3: The cvss v3 score for the vulnerability.
    cvssVersion: Output only. CVSS version used to populate cvss_score and
      severity.
    effectiveSeverity: The distro assigned severity for this vulnerability
      when it is available, and note provider assigned severity when distro
      has not yet assigned a severity for this vulnerability. When there are
      multiple PackageIssues for this vulnerability, they can have different
      effective severities because some might be provided by the distro while
      others are provided by the language ecosystem for a language pack. For
      this reason, it is advised to use the effective severity on the
      PackageIssue level. In the case where multiple PackageIssues have
      differing effective severities, this field should be the highest
      severity for any of the PackageIssues.
    extraDetails: Occurrence-specific extra details about the vulnerability.
    longDescription: Output only. A detailed description of this
      vulnerability.
    packageIssue: Required. The set of affected locations and their fixes (if
      available) within the associated resource.
    relatedUrls: Output only. URLs related to this vulnerability.
    severity: Output only. The note provider assigned Severity of the
      vulnerability.
    shortDescription: Output only. A one sentence description of this
      vulnerability.
    type: The type of package; whether native or non native(ruby gems, node.js
      packages etc)
    vexAssessment: A VexAssessment attribute.
