def get_margeff(self, at='overall', method='dydx', atexog=None, dummy=False, count=False):
    """Get marginal effects of the fitted model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        at : str, optional
            Options are:

            - 'overall', The average of the marginal effects at each
              observation.
            - 'mean', The marginal effects at the mean of each regressor.
            - 'median', The marginal effects at the median of each regressor.
            - 'zero', The marginal effects at zero for each regressor.
            - 'all', The marginal effects at each observation. If `at` is all
              only margeff will be available from the returned object.

            Note that if `exog` is specified, then marginal effects for all
            variables not specified by `exog` are calculated using the `at`
            option.
        method : str, optional
            Options are:

            - 'dydx' - dy/dx - No transformation is made and marginal effects
              are returned.  This is the default.
            - 'eyex' - estimate elasticities of variables in `exog` --
              d(lny)/d(lnx)
            - 'dyex' - estimate semi-elasticity -- dy/d(lnx)
            - 'eydx' - estimate semi-elasticity -- d(lny)/dx

            Note that tranformations are done after each observation is
            calculated.  Semi-elasticities for binary variables are computed
            using the midpoint method. 'dyex' and 'eyex' do not make sense
            for discrete variables. For interpretations of these methods
            see notes below.
        atexog : array_like, optional
            Optionally, you can provide the exogenous variables over which to
            get the marginal effects.  This should be a dictionary with the key
            as the zero-indexed column number and the value of the dictionary.
            Default is None for all independent variables less the constant.
        dummy : bool, optional
            If False, treats binary variables (if present) as continuous.  This
            is the default.  Else if True, treats binary variables as
            changing from 0 to 1.  Note that any variable that is either 0 or 1
            is treated as binary.  Each binary variable is treated separately
            for now.
        count : bool, optional
            If False, treats count variables (if present) as continuous.  This
            is the default.  Else if True, the marginal effect is the
            change in probabilities when each observation is increased by one.

        Returns
        -------
        DiscreteMargins : marginal effects instance
            Returns an object that holds the marginal effects, standard
            errors, confidence intervals, etc. See
            `statsmodels.discrete.discrete_margins.DiscreteMargins` for more
            information.

        Notes
        -----
        Interpretations of methods:

        - 'dydx' - change in `endog` for a change in `exog`.
        - 'eyex' - proportional change in `endog` for a proportional change
          in `exog`.
        - 'dyex' - change in `endog` for a proportional change in `exog`.
        - 'eydx' - proportional change in `endog` for a change in `exog`.

        When using after Poisson, returns the expected number of events per
        period, assuming that the model is loglinear.
