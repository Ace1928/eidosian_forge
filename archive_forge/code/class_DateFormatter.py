(Americans should note that in many\n        other countries %d/%m/%y is rather common. This means that in\n        international context this format is ambiguous and should not\n        be used.)\n\n    %e\n        Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a\n        leading zero is replaced by a space.\n\n    %f\n        Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left (range\n        000000-999999). This is an extension to the set of directives\n        available to `timezone`_.\n\n    %F\n        Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format).\n\n    %G\n        The ISO 8601 week-based year with century as a decimal number.\n        The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see %V).\n        This has the same format and value as %Y, except that if the\n        ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year\n        is used instead.\n\n    %g\n        Like %G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit year (00-99).\n\n    %h\n        Equivalent to %b.\n\n    %H\n        The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00\n        to 23).\n\n    %I\n        The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01\n        to 12).\n\n    %j\n        The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).\n\n    %k\n        The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23).\n        Single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %H.)\n\n    %l\n        The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12).\n        Single digits are preceded by a blank. (See also %I.) (TZ)\n\n    %m\n        The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).\n\n    %M\n        The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).\n\n    %n\n        A newline character. Bokeh text does not currently support\n        newline characters.\n\n    %N\n        Nanosecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left (range\n        000000000-999999999). Supports a padding width specifier, i.e.\n        %3N displays 3 leftmost digits. However, this is only accurate\n        to the millisecond level of precision due to limitations of\n        `timezone`_.\n\n    %p\n        Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or the\n        corresponding strings for the current locale. Noon is treated\n        as "PM" and midnight as "AM".\n\n    %P\n        Like %p but in lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding\n        string for the current locale.\n\n    %r\n        The time in a.m. or p.m. notation. In the POSIX locale this\n        is equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p.\n\n    %R\n        The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M). For a version including\n        the seconds, see %T below.\n\n    %s\n        The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00\n        +0000 (UTC).\n\n    %S\n        The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60). (The range\n        is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)\n\n    %t\n        A tab character. Bokeh text does not currently support tab\n        characters.\n\n    %T\n        The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).\n\n    %u\n        The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1.\n        See also %w.\n\n    %U\n        The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range\n        00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of\n        week 01. See also %V and %W.\n\n    %V\n        The ISO 8601 week number (see NOTES) of the current year as a\n        decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week\n        that has at least 4 days in the new year. See also %U and %W.\n\n    %w\n        The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0.\n        See also %u.\n\n    %W\n        The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range\n        00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of\n        week 01.\n\n    %x\n        The preferred date representation for the current locale\n        without the time.\n\n    %X\n        The preferred time representation for the current locale\n        without the date.\n\n    %y\n        The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).\n\n    %Y\n        The year as a decimal number including the century.\n\n    %z\n        The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and\n        minute offset from UTC).\n\n    %Z\n        The timezone name or abbreviation.\n\n    %%\n        A literal \'%\' character.\n\n    .. warning::\n        The client library BokehJS uses the `timezone`_ library to\n        format datetimes. The inclusion of the list below is based on the\n        claim that `timezone`_ makes to support "the full compliment\n        of GNU date format specifiers." However, this claim has not\n        been tested exhaustively against this list.
