from ray.data._internal.dataset_logger import DatasetLogger
A backpressure policy that throttles the streaming outputs of the `DataOpTask`s.

    The are 2 levels of configs to control the behavior:
    - At the Ray Core level, we use
      `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_GENERATOR_BUFFER` to limit the number of blocks buffered in
      the streaming generator of each OpDataTask. When it's reached, the task will
      be blocked at `yield` until the caller reads another `ObjectRef.
    - At the Ray Data level, we use
      `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_GENERATOR_BUFFER` to limit the number of blocks buffered in the
      output queue of each operator. When it's reached, we'll stop reading from the
      streaming generators of the op's tasks, and thus trigger backpressure at the
      Ray Core level.

    Thus, total number of buffered blocks for each operator can be
    `MAX_BLOCKS_IN_GENERATOR_BUFFER * num_running_tasks +
    MAX_BLOCKS_IN_OP_OUTPUT_QUEUE`.
