    A `.Substitution` with two additional features:

    - Substitutions of the form ``%(classname:kwdoc)s`` (ending with the
      literal ":kwdoc" suffix) trigger lookup of an Artist subclass with the
      given *classname*, and are substituted with the `.kwdoc` of that class.
    - Decorating a class triggers substitution both on the class docstring and
      on the class' ``__init__`` docstring (which is a commonly required
      pattern for Artist subclasses).
