Pre-compute the average length of a document and inverse term document frequencies,
        which will be used to weight term frequencies for the documents.

        Parameters
        ----------
        corpus : iterable of iterable of (int, int) or None, optional
            An input corpus, which will be used to compute the average length of a document and
            inverse term document frequencies. If None, then `dictionary` will be used to compute
            the statistics. If both `corpus` and `dictionary` are None, the statistics will be left
            unintialized. Default is None.
        dictionary : :class:`~gensim.corpora.Dictionary`
            An input dictionary, which will be used to compute the average length of a document and
            inverse term document frequencies.  If None, then `corpus` will be used to compute the
            statistics. If both `corpus` and `dictionary` are None, the statistics will be left
            unintialized. Default is None.
        k1 : float
            A positive tuning parameter that determines the impact of the term frequency on its BM25
            weight. Singhal [5]_ suggests to set `k1` between 1.0 and 2.0. Default is 1.5.
        b : float
            A tuning parameter between 0.0 and 1.0 that determines the document length
            normalization: 1.0 corresponds to full document normalization, while 0.0 corresponds to
            no length normalization. Singhal [5]_ suggests to set `b` to 0.75, which is the default.
