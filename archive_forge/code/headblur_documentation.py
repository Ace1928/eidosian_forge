import numpy as np

    Returns a filter that will blurr a moving part (a head ?) of
    the frames. The position of the blur at time t is
    defined by (fx(t), fy(t)), the radius of the blurring
    by ``r_zone`` and the intensity of the blurring by ``r_blur``.
    Requires OpenCV for the circling and the blurring.
    Automatically deals with the case where part of the image goes
    offscreen.
