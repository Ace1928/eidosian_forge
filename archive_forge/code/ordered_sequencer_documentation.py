Publish message for this ordering key.

        Args:
            message:
                The Pub/Sub message.
            retry:
                The retry settings to apply when publishing the message.
            timeout:
                The timeout to apply when publishing the message.

        Returns:
            A class instance that conforms to Python Standard library's
            :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` interface (but not an
            instance of that class). The future might return immediately with a
            PublishToPausedOrderingKeyException if the ordering key is paused.
            Otherwise, the future tracks the lifetime of the message publish.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError:
                If called after this sequencer has been stopped, either by
                a call to stop() or after all batches have been published.
