        Wrapper to _eval_nseries if assumptions allow, else to series.

        If x is given, x0 is 0, dir='+', and self has x, then _eval_nseries is
        called. This calculates "n" terms in the innermost expressions and
        then builds up the final series just by "cross-multiplying" everything
        out.

        The optional ``logx`` parameter can be used to replace any log(x) in the
        returned series with a symbolic value to avoid evaluating log(x) at 0. A
        symbol to use in place of log(x) should be provided.

        Advantage -- it's fast, because we do not have to determine how many
        terms we need to calculate in advance.

        Disadvantage -- you may end up with less terms than you may have
        expected, but the O(x**n) term appended will always be correct and
        so the result, though perhaps shorter, will also be correct.

        If any of those assumptions is not met, this is treated like a
        wrapper to series which will try harder to return the correct
        number of terms.

        See also lseries().

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import sin, log, Symbol
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
        >>> sin(x).nseries(x, 0, 6)
        x - x**3/6 + x**5/120 + O(x**6)
        >>> log(x+1).nseries(x, 0, 5)
        x - x**2/2 + x**3/3 - x**4/4 + O(x**5)

        Handling of the ``logx`` parameter --- in the following example the
        expansion fails since ``sin`` does not have an asymptotic expansion
        at -oo (the limit of log(x) as x approaches 0):

        >>> e = sin(log(x))
        >>> e.nseries(x, 0, 6)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        PoleError: ...
        ...
        >>> logx = Symbol('logx')
        >>> e.nseries(x, 0, 6, logx=logx)
        sin(logx)

        In the following example, the expansion works but only returns self
        unless the ``logx`` parameter is used:

        >>> e = x**y
        >>> e.nseries(x, 0, 2)
        x**y
        >>> e.nseries(x, 0, 2, logx=logx)
        exp(logx*y)
