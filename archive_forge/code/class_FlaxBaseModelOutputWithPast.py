    Base class for model's outputs, with potential hidden states and attentions.

    Args:
        last_hidden_state (`jnp.ndarray` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`):
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        past_key_values (`Dict[str, jnp.ndarray]`):
            Dictionary of pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) that can be used for fast
            auto-regressive decoding. Pre-computed key and value hidden-states are of shape *[batch_size, max_length]*.
        hidden_states (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of shape
            `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(jnp.ndarray)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `jnp.ndarray` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length,
            sequence_length)`.

            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention
            heads.
