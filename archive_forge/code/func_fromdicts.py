    View a sequence of Python :class:`dict` as a table. E.g.::

        >>> import petl as etl
        >>> dicts = [{"foo": "a", "bar": 1},
        ...          {"foo": "b", "bar": 2},

        | 'c' |   2 |

    Argument `dicts` can also be a generator, the output of generator
    is iterated and cached using a temporary file to support further
    transforms and multiple passes of the table:

        >>> import petl as etl
        >>> dicts = ({"foo": chr(ord("a")+i), "bar":i+1} for i in range(3))
        >>> table1 = etl.fromdicts(dicts, header=['foo', 'bar'])
        >>> table1
        +-----+-----+
        | foo | bar |
        +=====+=====+
        | 'a' |   1 |
        +-----+-----+
        | 'b' |   2 |
        +-----+-----+
        | 'c' |   3 |
        +-----+-----+

    If `header` is not specified, `sample` items from `dicts` will be
    inspected to discovery dictionary keys. Note that the order in which
    dictionary keys are discovered may not be stable,

    See also :func:`petl.io.json.fromjson`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.1.0

    If no `header` is specified, fields will be discovered by sampling keys
    from the first `sample` dictionaries in `dicts`. The header will be
    constructed from keys in the order discovered. Note that this
    ordering may not be stable, and therefore it may be advisable to specify
    an explicit `header` or to use another function like
    :func:`petl.transform.headers.sortheader` on the resulting table to
    guarantee stability.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.7.5

    Full support of generators passed as `dicts` has been added, leveraging
    `itertools.tee`.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.7.11

    Generator support has been modified to use temporary file cache
    instead of `itertools.tee` due to high memory usage.
