def dup_decompose(f, K):
    """
    Computes functional decomposition of ``f`` in ``K[x]``.

    Given a univariate polynomial ``f`` with coefficients in a field of
    characteristic zero, returns list ``[f_1, f_2, ..., f_n]``, where::

              f = f_1 o f_2 o ... f_n = f_1(f_2(... f_n))

    and ``f_2, ..., f_n`` are monic and homogeneous polynomials of at
    least second degree.

    Unlike factorization, complete functional decompositions of
    polynomials are not unique, consider examples:

    1. ``f o g = f(x + b) o (g - b)``
    2. ``x**n o x**m = x**m o x**n``
    3. ``T_n o T_m = T_m o T_n``

    where ``T_n`` and ``T_m`` are Chebyshev polynomials.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys import ring, ZZ
    >>> R, x = ring("x", ZZ)

    >>> R.dup_decompose(x**4 - 2*x**3 + x**2)
    [x**2, x**2 - x]
