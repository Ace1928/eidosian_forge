      omitted, CA certificates and CRLs will be published in PEM.
    publishCaCert: Optional. When true, publishes each CertificateAuthority's
      CA certificate and includes its URL in the "Authority Information
      Access" X.509 extension in all issued Certificates. If this is false,
      the CA certificate will not be published and the corresponding X.509
      extension will not be written in issued certificates.
    publishCrl: Optional. When true, publishes each CertificateAuthority's CRL
      and includes its URL in the "CRL Distribution Points" X.509 extension in
      all issued Certificates. If this is false, CRLs will not be published
      and the corresponding X.509 extension will not be written in issued
      certificates. CRLs will expire 7 days from their creation. However, we
      will rebuild daily. CRLs are also rebuilt shortly after a certificate is
