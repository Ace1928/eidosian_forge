      vulnerabilities](https://cloud.google.com/container-
      analysis/docs/container-scanning-

      the rules described in the [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160)
      guidelines as follows: + **Filter for a specific severity type**: you
      can list reports that contain vulnerabilities that are classified as
      medium by specifying `vulnerabilities.details.severity:MEDIUM`. +
      **Filter for a range of severities** : you can list reports that have
      vulnerabilities that are classified as critical or high by specifying
      `vulnerabilities.details.severity:HIGH OR
      vulnerabilities.details.severity:CRITICAL`
    pageSize: The maximum number of results to return.
    pageToken: A pagination token returned from a previous call to
      `ListVulnerabilityReports` that indicates where this listing should
      continue from.
    parent: Required. The parent resource name. Format:
      `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/-` For `{project}`,
      either `project-number` or `project-id` can be provided.
