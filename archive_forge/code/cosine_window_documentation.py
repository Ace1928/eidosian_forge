Calculation of the state vector generated by the cosine window.

        Args:
            wire_order (Iterable, Wires): Custom order of wires for the returned state vector.

        Raises:
            WireError: Custom wire_order must contain all wires.

        Returns:
            TensorLike[complex]: output state
