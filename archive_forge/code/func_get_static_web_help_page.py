It tries to behave like the Wordnet project\'s web browser but the difference is that the NLTK Wordnet Browser uses a local Wordnet database.\n<p><b>You are using the Javascript client part of the NLTK Wordnet BrowseServer.</b> We assume your browser is in tab sheets enabled mode.</p>\n<p>For background information on Wordnet, see the Wordnet project home page: <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/"><b> https://wordnet.princeton.edu/</b></a>. For more information on the NLTK project, see the project home:\n<a href="https://www.nltk.org/"><b>https://www.nltk.org/</b></a>. To get an idea of what the Wordnet version used by this browser includes choose <b>Show Database Info</b> from the <b>View</b> submenu.</p>\n<h3>Word search</h3>\n<p>The word to be searched is typed into the <b>New Word</b> field and the search started with Enter or by clicking the <b>Search</b> button. There is no uppercase/lowercase distinction: the search word is transformed to lowercase before the search.</p>\n<p>In addition, the word does not have to be in base form. The browser tries to find the possible base form(s) by making certain morphological substitutions. Typing <b>fLIeS</b> as an obscure example gives one <a href="MfLIeS">this</a>. Click the previous link to see what this kind of search looks like and then come back to this page by using the <b>Alt+LeftArrow</b> key combination.</p>\n<p>The result of a search is a display of one or more\n<b>synsets</b> for every part of speech in which a form of the\nsearch word was found to occur. A synset is a set of words\nhaving the same sense or meaning. Each word in a synset that is\nunderlined is a hyperlink which can be clicked to trigger an\nautomatic search for that word.</p>\n<p>Every synset has a hyperlink <b>S:</b> at the start of its\ndisplay line. Clicking that symbol shows you the name of every\n<b>relation</b> that this synset is part of. Every relation name is a hyperlink that opens up a display for that relation. Clicking it another time closes the display again. Clicking another relation name on a line that has an opened relation closes the open relation and opens the clicked relation.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to give two or more words or collocations to be searched at the same time separating them with a comma like this <a href="Mcheer up,clear up">cheer up,clear up</a>, for example. Click the previous link to see what this kind of search looks like and then come back to this page by using the <b>Alt+LeftArrow</b> key combination. As you could see the search result includes the synsets found in the same order than the forms were given in the search field.</p>\n<p>\nThere are also word level (lexical) relations recorded in the Wordnet database. Opening this kind of relation displays lines with a hyperlink <b>W:</b> at their beginning. Clicking this link shows more info on the word in question.</p>\n<h3>The Buttons</h3>\n<p>The <b>Search</b> and <b>Help</b> buttons need no more explanation. </p>\n<p>The <b>Show Database Info</b> button shows a collection of Wordnet database statistics.</p>\n<p>The <b>Shutdown the Server</b> button is shown for the first client of the BrowServer program i.e. for the client that is automatically launched when the BrowServer is started but not for the succeeding clients in order to protect the server from accidental shutdowns.\n</p></body>\n</html>\n'
