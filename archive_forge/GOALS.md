# Goals: archive_forge

## 🎯 Immediate Goals
- [ ] **Preserve**: Ensure files are not accidentally deleted.
- [ ] **Ignore**: Ensure linters and tests skip this directory.
- [ ] **Pipeline**: Maintain the archive pipeline that extracts symbols into
  `archive/normalized/` with metadata exports.
- [ ] **Knowledge Sync**: Ensure archive outputs stay synchronized with
  `knowledge_forge` and GraphRAG indexes when enabled.

## 🔭 Long-term Vision
- Periodically mine for reusable code snippets to move to `code_forge`.
- Treat `archive_forge` as the canonical historical memory for all Eidosian
  projects, with repeatable archival runs.
