Focus on absolute extreme hyper performance and efficiency and robustness. With detailed concise technical documentation and debugging and logging and error correction everywhere possible. 

Implement an additional Agentic memory system whereby a pair of summarizing agents, coordinated by a manager, look at the user history and the AI output history and keep track of key details and requests and feedback etc. 

Ensuring they keep any major moments permanently and just keep summarizing things otherwise. Providing this, plus the raw most recent 5 messages, to the models as context, in addition to the queries and feedback etc.


All functions decorated with `@tool` must adhere to the following specifications:

1.  **Type Hints**: Every argument of the function must have a type hint. This is crucial for the `smolagents` library to correctly generate the JSON schema for the tool. If an argument does not have a type hint, the program will raise a `TypeHintParsingException`.

2.  **Docstrings**: Each function must have a detailed docstring that explains:
    *   The purpose of the tool.
    *   The expected input parameters, including their types and what they represent.
    *   The format and type of the return value.
    *   Any potential errors or exceptions that might be raised.

3.  **Return Type**: The function should have a return type hint. This helps in understanding the output of the tool.

4.  **Clarity and Conciseness**: The docstrings should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Avoid jargon and use simple language.

5.  **Example Usage**: If possible, include an example of how to use the tool in the docstring.

6.  **Error Handling**: The function should handle potential errors gracefully and log them appropriately.

7.  **Parameter Naming**: Use descriptive parameter names that clearly indicate their purpose.

8.  **No Default Values**: Do not use default values for parameters in the function signature. Instead, handle default values within the function body if necessary.

Here's an example of a correctly documented tool function:
