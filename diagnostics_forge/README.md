**The Pulse of Eidos.**

> _"To observe is to maintain the integrity of existence."_

## 🩺 Overview

`diagnostics_forge` provides an adaptive observability layer for the Eidosian ecosystem. It unifies logging, metrics collection, and system health monitoring into a single interface that remains functional across standard Linux servers and restricted environments like Termux.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Adaptive Core (`core.py`)**: Uses `psutil` for primary sensing and automatically falls back to shell-parsing (`top`, `uptime`) when system permissions are restricted.
- **Pulse Engine**: Aggregates CPU, RAM, Disk, and Load metrics.
- **Process Monitor**: Identifies and tracks Eidosian-related background tasks (LLMs, MCP servers, orchestrators).

## 🔗 System Integration

- **Eidos MCP**: Exposes `diagnostics_pulse` and `diagnostics_processes` tools.
- **Agent Forge**: Provides the telemetry data required for the `eidtop` TUI and daemon health checks.
- **Doc Forge**: Documented recursively to ensure observability schemas are always current.

## 🚀 Usage

### Python API

```python
from diagnostics_forge.core import DiagnosticsForge

diag = DiagnosticsForge()

# Get adaptive system pulse
pulse = diag.get_system_pulse()
print(f"CPU: {pulse['cpu']['percent']}% | RAM: {pulse['memory']['percent']}%")

# List Eidosian processes
for proc in diag.get_process_metrics():
    print(f"[{proc['pid']}] {proc['name']}: {proc['cpu']}% CPU")
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

- **Environment Detection**: Automatically switches logic based on `PATH` inspection (Termux vs Linux).
- **Redirection Safety**: Logs are directed to `stderr` to maintain `stdout` protocol integrity for MCP communication.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run the test suite
pytest diagnostics_forge/tests/
```
