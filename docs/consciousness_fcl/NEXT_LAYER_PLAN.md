# Next Layer Plan: Consciousness Lab Apparatus

This document operationalizes the new feedback into a production roadmap for `agent_forge`, `memory_forge`, `knowledge_forge`, and `eidos_mcp`.

## Objective

Evolve the current consciousness runtime from event-driven functionality into a traceable, falsifiable, experimentally rigorous lab platform.

## Scope

The plan is decomposed into focused implementation parts:

1. North star: causal traceability by ID across all modules.
2. Canonical schema + index layer.
3. Winner-linked ignition tracing.
4. Standardized trial harness.
5. Metrics suite v2 (connectivity + directionality + stability).
6. World model v1.5 (belief state + predictive coding + rollouts).
7. Simulation stream (internal generative percept mode).
8. Phenomenology probes (operational indices).
9. Perturbation library v2.
10. Ablation matrix + golden ranges.
11. Frontier upgrades.
12. PR execution order and release gates.
13. Adversarial self-red-team loop.
14. Self-upgrading loop substrate (param store + overlay + safe autotuner).
15. Adaptive policy/attention learning and experiment-designer frontier.
16. Autotune commit-path adversarial gates (candidate overlay must pass red-team checks before persistence).
17. Index-based benchmark extraction parity with runtime module indexing paths.
18. Security-audit workflow loop with optional severity hard gates and artifacted inventory reports.
19. Security inventory delta-to-issue remediation automation with baseline markers and close-on-clear behavior.
20. Workflow action pin drift audit with lock-file policy enforcement in CI.
21. Phase 16 remediation batch orchestration from security inventory to actionable issue queues.
22. Phase 17 deterministic pip dependency auto-patch execution with backup-safe write mode and idempotent verification.
23. Phase 17 no-fix advisory mitigation path (dependency minimization + manual vulnerable-range escape where safe and verifiable).
24. Phase 18 kernel watchdog reliability envelope with automatic module quarantine/recovery controls.
25. Phase 18 payload safety envelope with bounded serialization/truncation telemetry for event bus scalability.

## Principle

Every claim must map to measurable signatures, replayable traces, and ablation-sensitive benchmarks.
