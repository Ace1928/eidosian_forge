# Part 05: Perturb and Measure

## Goal

Provide falsifiability harness through controlled perturbations and quantitative response metrics.

## Perturbation Modes

- noise injection
- broadcast drop
- timing jitter
- state field zeroing

## Metrics

- event-type diversity
- source diversity
- compression ratio proxy
- temporal entropy proxy
- aggregate `metrics.rci`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Trial runs persist report artifacts with perturbation config and measured deltas.
- Metrics degrade predictably under ablations and excessive noise.
