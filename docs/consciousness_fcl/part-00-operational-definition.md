# Part 00: Operational Definition

## Goal

Define measurable, falsifiable correlates for the consciousness layer without metaphysical assumptions.

## Metrics

1. Global availability: workspace ignition density and cascade depth.
2. Bottlenecking: candidate-to-winner selectivity ratio.
3. Integration/differentiation: response complexity under perturbation.
4. Self-binding: agency and boundary confidence from efference matching.
5. Reportability: alignment of self-report claims to event evidence.

## Implementation Outputs

- Formal metric definitions and formulas.
- Event fields required to compute each metric.
- Support/falsification thresholds in config.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each metric can be computed directly from event logs.
- A trial report includes both support and disconfirmation signals.
