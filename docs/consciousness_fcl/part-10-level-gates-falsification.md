# Part 10: Level Gates and Falsification

## Goal

Map level labels to measurable signatures and explicit disconfirmation criteria.

## Proposed Level Gates

- L0: workspace active, no stable ignition cascades.
- L1: winner selection + reproducible ignition cascades + grounded reports.
- L2: stable agency/boundary estimates and perturbation-sensitive ownership effects.
- L3: cross-episode continuity and goal stability.
- L4: metacognitive mode detection calibrated to error dynamics.
- L5: counterfactual planning with perturbation resilience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each level has measurable pass/fail checks.
- Reports include confidence intervals and disconfirmers.
