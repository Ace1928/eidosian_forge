# Goals: eidos-brain

## 🎯 Immediate Goals
- [ ] **Standardization**: Ensure `pyproject.toml` drives the build/install process.
- [ ] **Typing**: Run `mypy` on `core/` and resolve errors (target 100%).
- [ ] **Testing**: Ensure `pytest` passes with the new Python 3.12 environment.

## 🔭 Long-term Vision
- Serve as the "Brain" for all other Forges.
- Integrate `memory_forge` for persistent storage.
- Integrate `agent_forge` for delegating tasks.
