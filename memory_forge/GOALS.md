**Focus**: EIDOS's cognitive memory system

---

## 🎯 Immediate Goals (This Sprint)

- [ ] Add ROADMAP, ISSUES, PLAN documentation
- [ ] Verify 100% test coverage
- [ ] Add concurrent access locking
- [ ] Performance benchmark suite

## 🏃 Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

- [ ] Distributed memory (Redis backend)
- [ ] Memory federation across agents
- [ ] Automatic importance scoring via LLM
- [ ] Memory visualization dashboard

## 🔭 Long-term Vision

### The Cognitive Memory Layer

> A scalable, distributed memory system that enables AI agents to maintain persistent identity, learn from experience, and share knowledge across sessions and instances.

#### Vision Features

1. **Distributed Architecture**
   - Redis/PostgreSQL backends
   - Multi-agent memory sharing
   - Conflict resolution

2. **Intelligent Memory Management**
   - LLM-driven importance scoring
   - Automatic consolidation
   - Forgetting curves

3. **Rich Retrieval**
   - Multi-modal search
   - Contextual relevance ranking
   - Time-aware retrieval

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Test coverage | 85% | 100% |
| Recall latency | 100ms | <50ms |
| Storage backends | 2 | 5 |
