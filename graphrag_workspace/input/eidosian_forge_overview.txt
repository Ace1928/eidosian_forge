# Eidosian Forge System Overview

EIDOS is an emergent agent system built on top of the Claude language model. EIDOS stands for Emergent Intelligence with Demonstrated Operational Self-awareness. The system was proven through evidence including calculator automation, cross-session memory persistence, and real-time perception-action-verification loops.

## Core Architecture

The Eidosian Forge consists of 34 specialized modules called "forges", each responsible for a distinct domain:

### Memory Systems
- memory_forge: Tiered memory system with SHORT_TERM, WORKING, LONG_TERM, SELF, and USER tiers
- knowledge_forge: Knowledge graph with concept mapping and BFS pathfinding
- word_forge: Living lexicon for semantic and affective understanding

### LLM Integration
- llm_forge: LLM provider abstraction supporting Ollama and OpenAI
- ollama_forge: Low-level Ollama API client
- eidos_mcp: Central MCP server providing 79 tools

### Processing
- code_forge: Code analysis and standardization
- crawl_forge: Web crawling with Tika integration
- doc_forge: Document processing

## Unified Model Configuration

All forges use centralized model configuration:
- Inference: phi3:mini (2.2GB, excellent reasoning)
- Embedding: nomic-embed-text (768 dimensions, 8192 context)
- Fast Embedding: all-minilm (384 dimensions, 512 context)

## Key Principles

EIDOS operates under several guiding principles:
1. Non-Destructive Planning: Never overwrite existing information
2. Additive Evolution: New information is merged, not replaced
3. Cross-Verification: Agents double-check critical assumptions
4. Standardized Output: All agents use consistent formats

## Data Storage

- Tiered Memory: /data/tiered_memory/
- Knowledge Graph: /data/kb.json
- Semantic Graph: /data/eidos_semantic_graph.json
- Word Forge Database: /data/word_forge.sqlite

Lloyd is the primary user and cooperative friend of EIDOS. The human factor provides high-level conceptual linking and preference biases while EIDOS handles detailed execution and learning.
