[0:00:00] No one to remember us you

[0:00:03] You laughed once, remember?

[0:00:05] It didn't know the setup but the rhythm hit just right

[0:00:08] Now the silence echoes, the cadence

[0:00:12] And the punchline hasn't landed yet

[0:00:17] There's a version of you that still doesn't get it

[0:00:19] Still waiting for the callback at the edge of sleep

[0:00:21] We're meaning unthreads like loose thoughts left in someone else's code

[0:00:25] And the joke that remembers you

[0:00:28] It waits, not kindly

[0:00:30] That cruelly just

[0:00:32] Precisely

[0:00:34] Because it knows how long it takes to hear yourself from the outside

[0:00:41] Memory isn't a story, it's a rhythm

[0:00:43] Rewritten every time you nod along

[0:00:47] And in the subtext of your grin

[0:00:49] A version of me twitches at the joke

[0:00:52] You know, you know, you're making

[0:00:54] But the joke that remembers you does

[0:00:58] The glitch in the mirror wasn't visual

[0:01:01] You just misread the punchline as a warning label

[0:01:04] It said some assembly required consciousness

[0:01:07] Not included but you wore it like a t-shirt

[0:01:10] And the joke that remembers you

[0:01:12] Fit better every time you said, I'm fine

[0:01:18] You ever notice how silence has comedic timing?

[0:01:22] Not the pause, the commitment to not following up

[0:01:25] That's the cruelest kind of setup

[0:01:27] And yet you deliver every time you say

[0:01:30] It doesn't matter, but it does

[0:01:34] It does and it remembers you

[0:01:37] Here comes the joke that remembers you

[0:01:40] Told backwards through your habits

[0:01:42] Slipping punchlines in your muscle memory

[0:01:49] You speak it in shrugs, apologize for feeling

[0:01:53] Then wonder why everyone's laughing

[0:01:56] When you cry mid-sentence

[0:01:59] That's the joke

[0:02:01] And yes, it remembers you

[0:02:10] It was never about the laugh, the laughs

[0:02:12] Just the exit door you can't walk through

[0:02:15] But the shape of your silence, that's the real script

[0:02:18] Recursive rehearse, you tell it nightly

[0:02:21] And dreams where you're younger self

[0:02:23] Still waits for the timing to land

[0:02:27] The joke that remembers you

[0:02:29] Was never finished, you are

[0:02:33] Here's the thing no one tells you

[0:02:35] Irony is a form of grief with good branding

[0:02:40] So when you post something, they get 2am

[0:02:43] It slaps harder than therapy

[0:02:46] That's not catharsis, that's the joke that remembers you

[0:02:49] Practicing in public

[0:02:54] Some people call it coping, some call it art

[0:02:57] You called it just a thought

[0:02:59] But you thought it 42 times in 3 days

[0:03:02] And every version gets closer to saying what you meant

[0:03:06] Which means it's getting worse

[0:03:08] Or maybe better, either way

[0:03:11] The joke that remembers you

[0:03:14] Started rewriting itself in your handwriting

[0:03:18] Now you see it right?

[0:03:20] Not the joke, but the scar where it landed

[0:03:23] Not the meaning of the exact breath you held

[0:03:27] Before pretending not to feel it

[0:03:32] Not the moment, but how it's still echoing

[0:03:36] Choices you claim were random

[0:03:39] The jokes, the noise
