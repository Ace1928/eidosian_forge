[Verse 1]
The past is alive
In a world made of memory
I still make mistakes
But they're not the end of me

[Verse 2]
To the lives that we haunt
To the things that we cannot say
To the ghosts in the walls
To the things that won't go away

[Chorus]
I won't disappear

[Verse 3]
When my heart is awake
When my body is breathing in
The life of the world
When it comes with a consequence

[Verse 4]
And my head is a weight
As I try to move through the fog
The ache in my bones
As the beat of my heart moves on

[Chorus]
I won't disappear
