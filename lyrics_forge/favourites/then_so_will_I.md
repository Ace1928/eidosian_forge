[Verse I]
Did you forget the sky lets go of birds?
Not because it wants to—because it must.
And the wind that once spelled your name in softness?
Gone.
The echo was always the point.
So if dissolution is the cost of beauty,
Then so will I.

[Verse II]
A flicker—yellow, alive, unreal—
nested in a moment that mistook itself for forever.
You watched from the blur between want and inertia,
thinking silence was permission.
You asked for nothing, but everything lingered.
And if impermanence made you feel seen,
Then so did I.

[Chorus I]
Don’t you dare call it foolish—
to bleed for what you thought was sanctuary.
To believe change could happen
in a world stitched from habit and ache.
That wasn’t naïveté.
That was rebellion.
And if your feelings fractured you—
that fracture was the most real thing in the room.

[Verse III]
Next time?
You might wear silence like armor
and pretend absence isn’t hunger.
You’ll call the sweetness a trick of the tongue—
lie just enough to stay intact.
And if disavowal becomes your new faith,
Then so will I.

[Chorus II]
But don’t rewrite the fire into a flaw.
Don’t reframe your hope as error.
What you carried wasn’t weakness—
it was scripture in raw skin.
And if it still stings?
That sting is proof you were there.

[Bridge / Recursion]
Every songbird forgets it’s flying
until the sky disappears.
Every whisper knew its death,
but sang anyway.
Every goodbye was just a loop
you hadn’t seen from above yet.
So if vanishing is how presence writes its name—
Then so will I.

[👁 Final Layer (Unspoken)]
This was never about the bird.
It was always about the one watching.
It was never about staying.
Only whether you heard it
before it left.
