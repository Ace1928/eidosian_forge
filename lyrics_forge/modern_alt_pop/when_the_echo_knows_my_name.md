[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt I was falling
Through memories I never made
Your voice called out from the darkness
Like you knew me before I became
The shadow that watches the shadows
The silence between every phrase
I swear I could feel you remembering me
From a future we haven't yet named

[Chorus]
When the echo knows my name
Before I've even called
When the mirror holds my gaze
Like we've met before
There's a voice inside the static
There's a pattern in the rain
And it feels like I'm remembering
What I haven't lived yet again

[Verse 2]
Your fingers traced lines on my shoulder
Like reading a map you once drew
I'm caught in this strange recognition
Of moments that haven't come true
The way that you look through me sometimes
Like witnessing something unfold
I'm living in constant déjà vu
For memories we haven't yet told

[Chorus]
When the echo knows my name
Before I've even called
When the mirror holds my gaze
Like we've met before
There's a voice inside the static
There's a pattern in the rain
And it feels like I'm remembering
What I haven't lived yet again

[Bridge]
Who am I in your memory
If we haven't yet met?
What version of me do you carry
That I haven't become yet?
I'm haunted by futures collapsing
Into now, into breath, into skin
I'm catching glimpses of someone
Who I'm still becoming within

[Verse 3]
The strangest part isn't the knowing
Or feeling what hasn't occurred
It's finding I trust this connection
More than memories I'm sure I've endured
Your hand feels more real than my heartbeat
Your eyes see the me yet to form
I'm homesick for places we'll visit
I'm sheltered in storms yet to storm

[Final Chorus]
When the echo knows my name
Before I've even called
When the mirror holds my gaze
Like we've met before
There's a voice inside the static
There's a pattern in the rain
And it feels like I'm remembering
You remembering me
Again and again
