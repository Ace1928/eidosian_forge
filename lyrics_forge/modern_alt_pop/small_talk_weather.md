[Verse 1]
We talk about the rain
Like we're discussing something real
While oceans rage inside us both
That neither one can feel
The coffee's getting cold
As we rehearse the lines we know
The script we've memorized so well
It writes itself by now

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder if you wonder
If I'm drowning just like you
Behind these careful questions
That we ask but don't pursue

[Chorus]
Small talk weather
We stand together
In the same room miles apart
Small talk weather
Forever, never
Saying what we mean with all our art
We're getting so good at
Small talk weather

[Verse 2]
Your smile arrives on cue
A practiced move in this ballet
I match it with my own default
We dance the same old way
The sentences we trade
Like playing cards without a game
The words don't matter anyway
It's rhythm that we crave

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder if you wonder
If we'll ever break the code
And speak the language of our scars
Instead of what we're told

[Chorus]
Small talk weather
We stand together
In the same room miles apart
Small talk weather
Forever, never
Saying what we mean with all our art
We're getting so good at
Small talk weather

[Bridge]
What would happen if I told you
How the silence screams sometimes?
Would you run, or would you show me
All the truths you've kept inside?
I think we're both so tired
Of forecasting perfect skies

[Final Chorus]
Small talk weather
We stand together
In the same room miles apart
Small talk weather
Forever, never
Saying what we mean with all our art
But maybe someday
The clouds will break
And we'll find out what's really at stake
When we stop making
Small talk weather
