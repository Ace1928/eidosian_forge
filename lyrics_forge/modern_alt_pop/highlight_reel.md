[Verse 1]
We're all just editing our stories
Cutting scenes that look too real
One take for friends, one for family
And one we hope no one will steal
Best light, best angle, best morning
While the mess waits off the screen
I've got seventeen versions of normal
None of them exactly me

[Chorus]
This is my highlight reel
The parts I let you see
The carefully curated fantasy
Where I'm always fine, always strong
Always right where I belong
But the outtakes might heal
If I showed them to you
Would you show me yours too?

[Verse 2]
Three AM thoughts don't make the cut
Neither do the bathroom cries
I've perfected the art of the pivot
"Anyway, enough about my life"
We're method actors in our own movies
Playing characters called our names
Everyone's watching their own reflection
No one's seeing the same thing

[Chorus]
This is my highlight reel
The parts I let you see
The carefully curated fantasy
Where I'm always fine, always strong
Always right where I belong
But the outtakes might heal
If I showed them to you
Would you show me yours too?

[Bridge]
What if all the deleted scenes
Are actually the plot?
What if the real story lives
In everything we crop?
The trembling hand, the voice that breaks
The doubt behind the smile
The moments when we're truly seen
If only for a while

[Verse 3]
So here's my unedited footage
Raw and poorly lit
No filter, no soundtrack, no caption
Just whatever this is
It's terrifying and ordinary
Both broken and complete
The director's cut of a person
Still learning how to be

[Final Chorus]
That was my highlight reel
The parts I let you see
But here's the unfiltered reality
Where I'm sometimes lost, sometimes wrong
Sometimes don't know where I belong
And maybe we both might heal
If I showed this to you
Now please, show me yours too
