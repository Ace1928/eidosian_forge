[Verse 1]
I dated another ghost last night
Found your fingerprints on everything I own
Can’t decide if it counts as haunted
Or if lonely's all I've ever known
Collecting memories like data points
From everyone who didn't stay
Maybe I've been solving equations wrong—
Or asking the wrong questions anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got theories stacked like books
On why my heart won't just behave
But every time I map the reasons
The roads rearrange
Something beautiful in the chaos
When logic slips away

[Chorus]
I'm more than some equation
Love’s not math you solve alone
You can't debug emotions
Or rewrite truths your body knows
The language of desire is messy
It's poetry that never rhymes
And I wouldn't fix this glitch inside me
That hopes "someday" arrives

[Verse 2]
Three drinks deep, at half-past two
Writing novels you'll never read
To someone already dreaming
Unaware they're haunting me
Friends tell me simplify—
Write clean code for moving on
But my heart's still failing every test
It knows you've gone, but won't respond

[Pre-Chorus]
I've traced my steps in circles
Replayed every line and scene
Yet every careful script dissolves
When you appear on-screen
Something messy in the storyline
That makes it feel complete

[Chorus]
I'm more than some equation
Love’s not math you solve alone
You can't debug emotions
Or rewrite truths your body knows
The syntax of affection is reckless
No clean code, just poetry
And I refuse to fix this glitch inside me
That believes in "meant to be"

[Bridge]
Maybe there's a version of me
In another life's retake
Who figured out the recipe
For painless heartbreak
But I'm stuck here
Running feelings outdated
On a heart that's complicated
Never learning why goodbyes are made

[Final Chorus]
I'm more than calculation
Love’s no algorithm set in stone
You can't debug these feelings
They’re etched deep into your bones
Missing someone isn't tidy
It’s ink spilled on your best-laid plans
And I won't erase this beautiful chaos
That believes there's something human
In the mess we call love
